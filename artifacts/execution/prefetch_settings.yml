details:
  what: |
    Windows Prefetch service configuration that controls prefetch file creation,
    SuperFetch/SysMain service behavior, ReadyBoot optimization, and application
    launch optimization. Determines what execution evidence is preserved in prefetch
    files and how the system optimizes application startup performance through
    predictive loading and caching mechanisms.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows if prefetch was disabled to hide execution evidence, reveals prefetch
    configuration that affects forensic artifact availability, and indicates
    system optimization settings that impact investigation capabilities. Critical
    for understanding why prefetch evidence may be missing and assessing the
    completeness of execution artifact preservation on the system.

  structure: |
    EnablePrefetcher controls prefetch functionality (0=disabled, 1=application,
    2=boot, 3=both). EnableSuperfetch controls intelligent memory management.
    SysMain service settings control advanced prefetch and memory optimization.
    MaxPrefetchFiles limits the number of prefetch files retained on the system.

  examples:
    - "EnablePrefetcher: 3 (Applications and boot prefetch enabled)"
    - "EnableSuperfetch: 1 (SuperFetch enabled)"
    - "SysMain\\Start: 2 (Automatic startup)"
    - "SysMain\\Type: 32 (Win32 service, share process)"
    - "MaxPrefetchFiles: 128 (maximum prefetch file retention)"
    - "EnableBootTrace: 1 (boot tracing enabled)"
    - "TracingPath: %SystemRoot%\\Prefetch"
    - "BootTracingPolicy: 3 (comprehensive boot tracing)"
    - "Disabled: EnablePrefetcher: 0 (forensic evidence disabled)"
