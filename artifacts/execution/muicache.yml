details:
  what: |
    Windows MUICache stores the friendly display names of executed programs
    for multilingual interface support. Tracks applications that have been
    run by caching their localized names, descriptions, and version information.
    Helps Windows display proper application names in various UI contexts regardless
    of system language settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides evidence of program execution with human-readable application names.
    Complements other execution artifacts by showing what programs were actually
    launched with their proper names. Useful for identifying renamed executables,
    suspicious programs masquerading as legitimate software, and portable applications.
    Can reveal execution of programs that may not appear in other execution artifacts.

  structure: |
    Full executable paths as value names with corresponding friendly names as
    REG_SZ value data. Includes both system programs and user applications.
    Cache persists across reboots and system updates. Path format includes
    drive letters and full directory structures for precise program identification.

    - "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe: Command Prompt"
    - "C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe: Notepad++"
