details:
  what: |
    Docker Desktop manages container development including container creation,
    image management, volume mounting, and network configuration. Registry stores
    installation settings, runtime preferences, resource allocations, and integration
    configurations for comprehensive containerized development environment analysis
    and modern application deployment workflow tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating containerized application development, potential
    isolation bypass attempts, container-based malware analysis, and modern
    development workflows. Shows evidence of container usage, image downloads,
    development environment setups, and can reveal container-based data exfiltration,
    isolated development activities, and advanced development practices.

  structure: |
    Docker Desktop configuration includes installation paths, resource settings,
    container runtime preferences, volume mount configurations, and network
    settings. Container registry tracks image repositories, development workflows,
    and containerization activities for comprehensive container platform analysis.
