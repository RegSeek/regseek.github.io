  - "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths"

details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains registry entries that allow applications to be executed
    from command line, Run dialog, or Start menu search without specifying full paths.
    Contains default executable paths, working directories, and PATH environment
    additions for registered applications. Enables convenient application launching
    and provides application location information for Windows shell operations.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows applications registered for easy execution, can reveal malware that
    registers itself for convenient access from command line or Run dialog,
    indicates software installation patterns, and shows potential execution
    methods. Useful for understanding available execution vectors, identifying
    malicious applications that register for easy access, and tracking application installations.

  structure: |
    Application names as subkeys with default value pointing to full executable
    path. Optional Path value specifies additional directories to add to PATH
    environment variable during execution. DropTarget value indicates drag-and-drop
    support. Values stored as REG_SZ with optional REG_EXPAND_SZ for environment variables.

  examples:
    - "notepad.exe\\(Default): C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe"
    - "chrome.exe\\(Default): C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\chrome.exe"
    - "chrome.exe\\Path: C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome"
    - "malware.exe\\(Default): C:\\Temp\\malware.exe"
    - "python.exe\\(Default): C:\\Python39\\python.exe"
    - "python.exe\\Path: C:\\Python39;C:\\Python39\\Scripts"
    - "suspicious_tool.exe\\(Default): C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\tool.exe"
    - "cmd\\(Default): C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"
