details:
  what: |
    Visual Studio Code stores development environment configuration including workspace
    settings, installed extensions, recent projects, debugging configurations, and
    integrated terminal preferences. Registry manages file associations, protocol
    handlers, installation data, and integration settings for comprehensive code
    editing and development activity analysis in modern programming environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for investigating software development activities, code editing patterns,
    project access, and programming-related evidence. Shows evidence of code development,
    extension usage, workspace access, and can reveal unauthorized code modifications,
    software project involvement, development tool usage, and programming activities
    relevant to intellectual property investigations and insider threat analysis.

  structure: |
    VS Code configuration includes installation directories, file associations,
    protocol handlers, and workspace preferences. Extension data tracks installed
    development tools, language support, and productivity enhancements for
    comprehensive development environment analysis and programming activity tracking.

  examples:
    - "InstallLocation: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code"
    - "FileAssociation: .py -> Visual Studio Code"
    - "FileAssociation: .js -> Visual Studio Code"
    - "ProtocolHandler: vscode:// (VS Code URL protocol)"
    - "RecentWorkspace: C:\\Development\\ProjectName"
    - "RecentWorkspace: \\\\server\\shared\\source-code"
