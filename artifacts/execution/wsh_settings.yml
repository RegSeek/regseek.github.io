details:
  what: |
    Windows Script Host (WSH) provides native scripting capabilities for VBScript and JScript execution
    with comprehensive security and execution policy configuration. Controls script execution permissions,
    timeout settings, security zones, debugging capabilities, and engine-specific behaviors. Manages
    both system-wide and user-specific script execution policies for enterprise security and
    administrative automation while preventing unauthorized script-based attacks.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting script-based malware attacks, policy bypass attempts, and unauthorized
    script execution. Shows if WSH was disabled to prevent malicious script execution or enabled
    to facilitate attacks. Configuration changes may indicate attempts to execute malicious VBScript
    or JScript files, bypass security restrictions, or establish script-based persistence mechanisms.
    Essential for analyzing script-based attacks, macro malware, and fileless attack vectors.

  structure: |
    WSH configuration includes Enabled (global WSH enablement), Timeout (script execution timeout),
    DisplayLogo (banner display), TrustPolicy (script trust level), and UseWINSAFER (Windows SAFER
    integration). Settings control script engine behavior, security restrictions, execution timeouts,
    and debugging capabilities stored as REG_DWORD values with policy inheritance mechanisms.

  examples:
    - "Enabled: 0 (Windows Script Host completely disabled)"
    - "Enabled: 1 (WSH enabled for script execution)"
    - "Timeout: 0 (No timeout limit for script execution)"
    - "DisplayLogo: 0 (Suppress WSH banner when scripts run)"
    - "TrustPolicy: 0 (Allow all scripts to run)"
    - "TrustPolicy: 2 (Disallow all scripts - high security)"
    - "UseWINSAFER: 1 (Integrate with Software Restriction Policies)"
    - "Remote: 0 (Disable remote WSH execution)"
