details:
  what: |
    Windows Terminal manages modern command-line interface including shell profiles,
    appearance settings, key bindings, and terminal emulation preferences. Registry
    stores configuration profiles, color schemes, font preferences, and integration
    settings for comprehensive command-line activity analysis and system
    administration behavior tracking in modern Windows environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating command-line activities, system administration tasks,
    scripting behavior, and advanced user interactions. Shows evidence of terminal
    usage patterns, shell preferences, custom configurations, and can reveal
    system administration activities, scripting development, and command-line based
    attack techniques or administrative access patterns.

  structure: |
    Windows Terminal configuration includes profile definitions, appearance settings,
    key binding mappings, and startup preferences. Shell integration data tracks
    context menu additions, protocol handlers, and command-line interface
    customizations for comprehensive terminal usage analysis and administrative activity tracking.

  examples:
    - "DefaultProfile: {PowerShell GUID}"
    - "DefaultProfile: {Command Prompt GUID}"
    - "Profile: PowerShell 7 (Custom PowerShell Core profile)"
    - "Profile: WSL Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux)"
    - "StartupActions: new-tab --profile PowerShell"
    - "ColorScheme: Campbell (Terminal color theme)"
