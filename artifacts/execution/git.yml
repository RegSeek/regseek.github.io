details:
  what: |
    Git stores version control configuration including user credentials, repository
    settings, remote URLs, and development workflow preferences. Registry tracks
    installation paths, global configuration, credential helpers, and integration
    settings for comprehensive source code management analysis and development
    activity tracking in software projects and collaborative programming environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating software development activities, source code access,
    intellectual property theft, and evidence of programming work. Shows evidence
    of repository cloning, commit activity, remote server access, and can reveal
    unauthorized code access, stolen source code, insider development activities,
    and software project involvement in corporate or personal development scenarios.

  structure: |
    Git configuration includes installation directories, user identity settings,
    credential storage methods, repository paths, and integration preferences.
    Global configuration data shows default behavior, authentication methods,
    and remote repository access patterns for comprehensive development activity analysis.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\Git"
    - "GitConfig: user.name=John Developer"
    - "GitConfig: user.email=john@company.com"
    - "GitConfig: credential.helper=manager-core"
    - "RecentRepo: https://github.com/company/sensitive-project.git"
    - "RecentRepo: git@internal-server:proprietary-code.git"
    - "GitBash: C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"
