details:
  what: |
    Tor Browser manages privacy-focused web browsing including anonymity settings,
    proxy configurations, security levels, and anti-tracking preferences. Registry
    stores installation data, security configurations, bridge settings, and privacy
    preferences for comprehensive anonymous browsing analysis and privacy-conscious
    internet usage behavior tracking in sensitive or security-focused environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privacy-conscious behavior, potential anonymous
    communications, dark web access, and security-aware browsing patterns. Shows
    evidence of anonymity-seeking behavior, privacy tool usage, potential illicit
    activities, and can indicate attempts to evade monitoring, access restricted
    content, or maintain operational security in sensitive investigations.

  structure: |
    Tor Browser configuration includes proxy settings, security level preferences,
    bridge configurations, and anonymity options. Privacy settings track JavaScript
    restrictions, plugin blocking, and anti-fingerprinting measures for comprehensive
    privacy-focused browsing behavior analysis and security-conscious user profiling.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\Tor Browser"
    - "SecurityLevel: Safest (Highest security configuration)"
    - "BridgeSettings: obfs4 (Pluggable transport bridges)"
    - "NoScript: 1 (JavaScript blocking enabled)"
    - "Letterboxing: 1 (Anti-fingerprinting protection)"
    - "ProxyType: SOCKS5 (Tor proxy configuration)"
    - "ExitCountry: {us} (Preferred exit node country)"
