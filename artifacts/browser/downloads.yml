details:
  what: |
    Browser download configuration controls default download locations, security restrictions,
    file type handling, automatic download behavior, and download management policies.
    Manages download folder settings, security zone restrictions, file execution policies,
    and malware protection settings for safe file downloading across web browsers.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating malware delivery mechanisms, unauthorized software downloads,
    and data exfiltration through download channels. Shows evidence of download folder
    modifications that could facilitate malware execution, reveals download security
    bypasses, and indicates attempts to modify browser security to enable dangerous
    downloads essential for malware distribution and system compromise.

  structure: |
    Download configuration includes Download Directory (default save location), Security
    settings for download zones, file type associations, automatic execution policies,
    and download notification preferences. Security restrictions control download behavior
    in different zones with policy enforcement for enterprise environments.

  examples:
    - "Download Directory: C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads (Standard download location)"
    - "Download Directory: C:\\Temp\\Malware (Suspicious download location)"
    - "DisableFirstRunCustomize: 1 (Skip security setup wizard)"
    - "Check_Associations: no (Disable file association checking)"
    - "Safety Warning Level: Low (Reduced download security warnings)"
    - "NoSelectDownloadDir: 1 (Prevent download folder selection)"
    - "RestrictFileDownload: 0 (Allow all file downloads)"
