details:
  what: |
    ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects that provide interactive functionality
    in Internet Explorer and other applications. Registry manages control registration, security
    settings, kill bits for blocking dangerous controls, compatibility flags, and distribution
    unit management. Controls ActiveX behavior, installation permissions, security zones, and
    browser integration for enhanced web functionality with comprehensive security management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating browser-based attacks, malicious ActiveX control installation,
    and web-based malware delivery. Shows evidence of dangerous ActiveX controls that were
    installed or blocked, reveals attempts to exploit ActiveX vulnerabilities, and indicates
    security policy modifications that weaken browser defenses. Essential for analyzing
    drive-by downloads, browser exploits, and ActiveX-based persistence mechanisms.

  structure: |
    ActiveX Compatibility contains CLSID entries with Compatibility Flags controlling behavior,
    kill bits preventing execution of dangerous controls, and version-specific settings.
    Distribution Units track downloaded controls with authentication information. Kill bits
    stored as REG_DWORD values prevent specific controls from running for security protection.

  examples:
    - "ActiveX Compatibility\\{CLSID}\\Compatibility Flags: 0x00000400 (Kill bit set - control blocked)"
    - "ActiveX Compatibility\\{6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6}\\Compatibility Flags: 0x00000000 (Windows Media Player control allowed)"
    - "Distribution Units\\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}: Adobe Flash Player control"
    - "CLSID\\{CLSID}\\InprocServer32: C:\\malware\\malicious_control.dll (Suspicious ActiveX control)"
    - "Kill Bit: Compatibility Flags: 0x00000400 (ActiveX control disabled for security)"
    - "CodeBase: http://malicious-site.com/exploit.cab (Dangerous download location)"
