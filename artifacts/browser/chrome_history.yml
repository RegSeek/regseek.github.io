details:
  what: |
    Chrome and Edge Chromium-based browsers store configuration data, extension information,
    enterprise policy settings, homepage URLs, search engine preferences, and browser state
    information in the registry for system-wide settings and Group Policy enforcement.
    Manages security policies, extension permissions, profile configurations, and browser
    behavior controls for comprehensive web browsing security and functionality.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for browser-based investigations including malicious extension detection, homepage
    hijacking analysis, enterprise policy bypass attempts, and browser-based data exfiltration.
    Shows browser usage patterns, installed extensions that could be malicious, policy restrictions
    that may have been circumvented, and evidence of browser-based attacks or command and control
    communication through browser configurations and extension installations.

  structure: |
    Hierarchical registry structure containing browser preferences, extension lists, policy settings,
    and user profile information. Configuration data stored as JSON-formatted values for complex
    settings, REG_DWORD for boolean options, and REG_SZ for text preferences. Separate branches
    for user preferences and machine-wide Group Policy enforcement.

  examples:
    - "HomepageLocation: http://malicious-site.com (Potential homepage hijacking)"
    - "Extensions\\\\Installed: [{\"extension_id\": \"malicious_extension\"}]"
    - "DefaultSearchProviderSearchURL: http://evil-search.com/search?q={searchTerms}"
    - "Policies\\\\URLBlocklist: [\"*.legitimate-security-site.com\"] (Blocking security sites)"
    - "PreferenceMACs: [MAC values for preference integrity verification]"
    - "Profile Path: C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data"
    - "BookmarkBarEnabled: 1 (Bookmark bar visibility)"
