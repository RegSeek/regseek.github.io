details:
  what: |
    Internet Explorer security zones framework controls website trust levels, security policies,
    ActiveX control permissions, script execution restrictions, and download behaviors based
    on website categorization. Manages Internet, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted
    Sites zones with granular security settings, custom site assignments, and enterprise
    policy enforcement for comprehensive web browsing security management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating browser-based attacks, malicious website interactions, and
    security policy bypass attempts. Shows evidence of trusted site modifications that could
    facilitate attacks, restricted site configurations that may have been circumvented,
    and security zone changes that weaken browser defenses. Essential for analyzing
    browser-based malware delivery, social engineering attacks, and policy violations.

  structure: |
    Security zones numbered 0-4 (My Computer, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, Internet, Restricted)
    with detailed security settings as REG_DWORD values. ZoneMap contains site-to-zone assignments
    with domain classifications. Policy enforcement controls enterprise-wide browser security
    through Group Policy with inheritance and override mechanisms for centralized management.

  examples:
    - "Zones\\1\\1001: 3 (Local Intranet - Prompt for ActiveX download)"
    - "Zones\\2\\1200: 0 (Trusted Sites - Enable ActiveX controls)"
    - "Zones\\3\\1400: 1 (Internet - Disable active scripting)"
    - "Zones\\4\\1001: 3 (Restricted - Disable ActiveX completely)"
    - "ZoneMap\\Domains\\malicious-site.com: 4 (Restricted zone assignment)"
    - "ZoneMap\\Domains\\intranet.company.com: 1 (Local Intranet zone)"
    - "Policies\\DisableSecuritySettingsCheck: 1 (Security warnings disabled)"
    - "ProtectedMode\\Enabled: 0 (Protected Mode disabled - security risk)"
