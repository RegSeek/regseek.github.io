details:
  what: |
    Firefox browser registration and configuration data stored in Windows registry including
    installation information, version details, profile directory locations, default browser
    settings, update preferences, and file association handlers. Manages Firefox integration
    with Windows shell, protocol handlers, and system-wide browser configuration for
    comprehensive web browsing functionality and system integration.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for Firefox-based investigations including web browsing activity analysis,
    profile location identification for further examination, installation timeline establishment,
    and browser preference analysis. Shows Firefox usage patterns, configuration modifications
    that might indicate security bypasses, and integration with system shell for protocol
    handling. Critical for investigations involving Firefox-specific browsing artifacts.

  structure: |
    Installation information organized under Mozilla\\Firefox including CurrentVersion, install
    directory paths, profile management settings, and update configurations. File associations
    stored in Classes registry showing protocol handlers for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and custom
    protocols. Profile settings include default profile locations and user-specific configurations.
