details:
  what: |
    Internet Explorer maintains a record of URLs that users manually type in the address bar
    for autocomplete functionality and user convenience. Stores chronological order of manual
    URL entry with corresponding timestamps for each typed address. Provides evidence of
    intentional website navigation rather than accidental clicks or redirect-based visits.

  forensic_value: |
    Extremely valuable for investigating intentional website visits, manual navigation to
    suspicious or malicious sites, and user browsing intent analysis. Shows deliberate
    attempts to access specific websites, command and control domains manually entered,
    unauthorized browsing to restricted sites, and evidence of users actively seeking
    specific content or services. Critical for establishing intent in cybercrime investigations.

  structure: |
    Sequential value names (url1, url2, url3, etc.) containing full URLs as REG_SZ data.
    TypedURLsTime contains corresponding binary FILETIME timestamps for each URL entry.
    Most recent entries receive higher sequential numbers, maintaining chronological order
    of manual URL entry events with precise timing information.

  examples:
    - "url1: https://www.google.com (Common search engine access)"
    - "url2: https://malicious-domain.com (Suspicious manual navigation)"
    - "url3: http://192.168.1.100:8080 (Direct IP address with non-standard port)"
    - "url4: ftp://internal-server.company.com (Internal FTP server access)"
    - "url5: https://darkweb-marketplace.onion (Tor hidden service access)"
    - "TypedURLsTime: Binary FILETIME timestamps corresponding to each URL"
    - "url6: https://sensitive-competitor-site.com (Potential corporate espionage)"
