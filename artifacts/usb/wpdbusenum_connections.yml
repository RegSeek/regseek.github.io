details:
  what: |
    Windows Portable Device Bus Enumerator (WPDBUSENUM) tracks connections of portable devices including
    smartphones, digital cameras, media players, tablets, and other MTP/PTP devices that don't appear
    as traditional storage devices. Manages device enumeration, driver associations, and connection
    metadata for portable devices that use Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) or Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP)
    for advanced device interaction and media synchronization.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for mobile device forensics and investigations involving smartphones, tablets, and digital
    cameras. Shows evidence of mobile device connections that could indicate data transfer, photo/video
    extraction, or mobile device exploitation. Essential for cases involving mobile-based evidence,
    BYOD policy violations, unauthorized device connections, and mobile-to-PC data transfer activities.
    Can reveal connections even when devices don't mount as traditional drives.

  structure: |
    Device entries organized under WPDBUSENUM with unique device identifiers containing DeviceDesc
    (device description), HardwareID (vendor/product identification), Service (driver association),
    ContainerID (device grouping), and connection metadata. Each device maintains enumeration data,
    capabilities information, and driver binding details for comprehensive portable device tracking.

  examples:
    - "WPDBUSENUM\\\\{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}\\\\0000: iPhone connection"
    - "DeviceDesc: Apple iPhone (Device description)"
    - "HardwareID: WPDBUSENUM\\\\Apple_iPhone (Hardware identification)"
    - "Service: WUDFRd (Windows User-Mode Driver Framework)"
    - "ContainerID: {abcdef12-3456-789a-bcde-f123456789ab} (Device container)"
    - "FriendlyName: John's iPhone (User-assigned device name)"
    - "Manufacturer: Apple Inc. (Device manufacturer)"
    - "DeviceInterfaceGUIDs: Media Transfer Protocol interfaces"
