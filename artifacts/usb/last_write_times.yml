details:
  what: |
    Registry key last write times provide precise timestamps indicating when USB storage devices
    were last connected, enumerated, or had their configuration updated by the Windows Plug and Play
    subsystem. These timestamps correlate directly with device connection events, driver installations,
    and hardware configuration changes, offering forensic investigators exact timing information
    for USB device interactions with the system.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for establishing precise USB device connection timelines in data exfiltration investigations,
    insider threat cases, and malware delivery scenarios. Provides exact timestamps for when specific
    USB devices were connected, enabling correlation with file access logs, user activity, and security
    events. Essential for proving temporal relationships between device connections and suspicious
    file operations, establishing evidence chains, and timeline reconstruction in digital forensics.

  structure: |
    Registry key timestamps stored in NTFS metadata as FILETIME structures (64-bit values representing
    100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 UTC). Each USB device subkey's last write time
    indicates most recent connection or configuration change. Device enumeration hierarchy preserves
    connection chronology with vendor ID, product ID, and serial number correlation.

  examples:
    - "Device Key: USBSTOR\\\\Disk&Ven_Kingston&Prod_DataTraveler_3.0&Rev_PMAP"
    - "Last Write Time: 2024-01-15 09:45:23.123 UTC (Precise connection timestamp)"
    - "Serial Number: 50E549C6E258F571&0 (Unique device identifier)"
    - "Device Instance: 001CC0EC336BD480&0 (Hardware instance ID)"
    - "Parent Key: USB\\\\VID_0951&PID_1666 (Vendor/Product identification)"
    - "Connection Event: Registry key modification indicates device enumeration"
