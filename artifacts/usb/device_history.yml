details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains comprehensive USB device connection history including all connected USB
    storage devices, their vendor/product identifiers, serial numbers, connection timestamps,
    device properties, and enumeration data. Tracks both current and historical USB device
    connections with detailed hardware identification, driver associations, and device capabilities
    for complete USB forensic analysis and device tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for USB-based investigations including data exfiltration, malware delivery,
    and unauthorized device usage. Provides complete history of USB devices connected to
    the system, enabling identification of specific devices used for data theft, malware
    introduction, or unauthorized access. Critical for establishing device usage timelines,
    correlating USB activity with security incidents, and identifying recurring suspicious devices.

  structure: |
    USBSTOR contains storage device entries with vendor, product, version, and unique serial
    numbers. USB enumeration tracks all USB devices including non-storage items. Portable
    Devices manages device-specific settings and capabilities. EMDMgmt contains external
    device management policies and ReadyBoost configuration for USB optimization and security.
