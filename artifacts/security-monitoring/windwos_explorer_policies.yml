details:
  what: |
    Windows Explorer policy framework controls user interface restrictions, folder access permissions, 
    desktop limitations, shell behavior modifications, and administrative security controls. Manages 
    Group Policy enforcement for Explorer functionality and file system access restrictions.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating administrative security bypass attempts, policy modifications that 
    facilitate unauthorized access, and evidence of system restrictions being circumvented. Shows 
    if attackers disabled security controls to hide malicious activity or modified restrictions.

  structure: |
    Policy values stored as REG_DWORD entries controlling specific Explorer restrictions and behaviors. 
    Common policies include NoRun (disable Run dialog), NoControlPanel (hide Control Panel), and 
    folder access restrictions. Advanced settings control file system behavior.

  examples:
    - "NoRun: 1 (Run dialog disabled - restricts command execution)"
    - "NoControlPanel: 1 (Control Panel access hidden - limits system configuration)"
    - "NoDesktop: 1 (Desktop functionality disabled - severe restriction)"
    - "NoFileMenu: 1 (File menu disabled in Explorer - limits file operations)"
    - "Hidden: 2 (Show hidden files and folders - security setting modified)"
    - "HideFileExt: 0 (Show file extensions - security enhancement)"
    - "NoFolderOptions: 1 (Folder Options access disabled)"
    - "RestrictRun: 1 (Restrict specific executable execution)"

limitations:
  - "Policy settings do NOT prove security bypass attempts occurred"
  - "Restriction modifications may be legitimate administrative changes"
  - "Explorer limitations don't indicate successful policy circumvention"
  - "Interface restrictions don't prove unauthorized access happened"
  - "Policy enforcement may have legitimate business or security justifications"
  - "Setting modifications don't indicate malicious intent or compromise"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_bypass_proof:
    - "Event logs showing unauthorized access despite policy restrictions"
    - "Process execution logs showing restricted applications launched successfully"
    - "File system artifacts showing access to restricted folders or files"
    - "Registry changes showing policy modifications during suspicious timeframes"
    - "Application logs showing successful operations despite interface restrictions"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "User activity logs showing attempts to access restricted functionality"
    - "Registry changes in other security settings during policy modification periods"
    - "Event logs showing Group Policy refresh attempts during restriction changes"
    - "File modifications in system areas despite access restrictions"
