details:
  what: |
    Local Security Policy encompasses comprehensive security configuration including audit policies, 
    user rights assignments, security options, account policies, Local Security Authority (LSA) 
    settings, and system security behavior controls. Manages authentication requirements and logging.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting security policy modifications that facilitate attacks, privilege escalation 
    attempts, and evidence tampering through disabled auditing. Shows if attackers weakened security 
    settings to maintain persistence or disabled logging to hide activities.

  structure: |
    Security policy data stored in binary format within the SECURITY registry hive. LSA settings 
    control authentication behavior, audit policies, and security options. Policies registry contains 
    user-level security restrictions and Group Policy enforcement settings.

  examples:
    - "AuditLogonEvents: 0 (Logon auditing disabled - potential evidence hiding)"
    - "AuditObjectAccess: 3 (Success and failure auditing enabled)"
    - "LSA\\\\LimitBlankPasswordUse: 0 (Blank passwords allowed - security weakness)"
    - "LSA\\\\NoLMHash: 1 (LM hash storage disabled for security)"
    - "CrashOnAuditFail: 0 (System continues if audit log full)"
    - "MinimumPasswordLength: 0 (No minimum password length required)"
    - "MaximumPasswordAge: 4294967295 (Passwords never expire)"
    - "EnableGuestAccount: 1 (Guest account enabled - security risk)"

limitations:
  - "Security policy settings do NOT prove actual security events occurred"
  - "Audit configuration doesn't indicate what events were successfully logged"
  - "Password policy settings don't prove weak passwords are in use"
  - "Authentication settings don't indicate successful authentication attacks"
  - "Policy modifications may be legitimate administrative security adjustments"
  - "LSA configuration doesn't prove credential harvesting occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_attack_proof:
    - "Event logs showing successful attacks despite security policy settings"
    - "Authentication logs confirming weak password exploitation"
    - "Audit trail gaps correlating with disabled auditing periods"
    - "Registry changes showing security policy modifications during attack windows"
    - "Process execution logs showing privilege escalation using weakened policies"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing multiple failed authentication attempts during weak policy periods"
    - "File system access logs showing unauthorized access during reduced security"
    - "Network logs showing lateral movement during disabled auditing periods"
    - "User activity logs showing suspicious behavior during security policy changes"
