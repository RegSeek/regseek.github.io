details:
  what: |
    Windows certificate stores manage Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) components including trusted 
    root certificate authorities, intermediate certificates, personal certificates, revoked certificates, 
    and cryptographic service provider configurations. Controls SSL/TLS trust relationships and 
    code signing verification.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting man-in-the-middle attacks through unauthorized certificate installation, 
    identifying certificate-based persistence mechanisms, and analyzing SSL/TLS interception attempts. 
    Reveals malicious certificate authorities installed by attackers and indicates advanced persistent 
    threat techniques using certificate manipulation.

  structure: |
    Certificate stores organized by purpose including ROOT (trusted authorities), CA (intermediate), 
    MY (personal), TrustedPeople (trusted users), and Disallowed (revoked). Each certificate stored 
    with binary data including public key, issuer information, validity dates, and thumbprint hash.

  examples:
    - "ROOT\\Certificates\\{SHA1-Thumbprint}: VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary CA"
    - "CA\\Certificates\\{Thumbprint}: Microsoft IT TLS CA 1 (Intermediate)"
    - "MY\\Certificates\\{Thumbprint}: Personal Authentication Certificate"
    - "Disallowed\\Certificates\\{Thumbprint}: Revoked DigiNotar Certificate"
    - "TrustedPeople\\{Thumbprint}: Corporate Code Signing Certificate"
    - "Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider: Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0"

limitations:
  - "Certificate installation does NOT prove man-in-the-middle attacks occurred"
  - "Trusted certificate presence doesn't indicate actual SSL/TLS interception happened"
  - "Certificate authority modifications may be legitimate enterprise security requirements"
  - "Cryptographic configuration changes don't prove security compromise"
  - "Root certificate additions may be for legitimate corporate monitoring or security tools"
  - "Certificate revocation doesn't indicate malicious activity was detected"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_attack_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing SSL/TLS connections using suspicious certificates"
    - "Application logs showing certificate validation failures or warnings"
    - "Browser logs showing certificate override events or security warnings"
    - "File system artifacts showing certificate installation during attack timeframes"
    - "Event logs showing certificate service operations and validation events"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Network logs showing encrypted traffic patterns consistent with certificate interception"
    - "Registry changes showing certificate installation correlating with attack periods"
    - "File modifications in certificate directories during suspicious activity"
    - "Event logs showing certificate errors or trust failures during communication"
