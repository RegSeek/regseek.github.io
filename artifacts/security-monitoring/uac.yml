details:
  what: |
    User Account Control (UAC) manages privilege elevation requests and administrative approval mode 
    for standard users and administrators. Registry controls prompt behavior, elevation policies, 
    secure desktop usage, and administrative token filtering to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privilege escalation attempts, UAC bypass techniques, and unauthorized 
    administrative access. Shows evidence of UAC policy modifications that could weaken security and 
    indicates sophisticated attacks targeting Windows privilege control mechanisms.

  structure: |
    UAC configuration includes EnableLUA (UAC enabled/disabled), ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin (admin 
    prompt behavior), ConsentPromptBehaviorUser (standard user prompts), PromptOnSecureDesktop 
    (secure desktop usage), and EnableInstallerDetection (installer privilege detection).

  examples:
    - "EnableLUA: 1 (UAC enabled)"
    - "EnableLUA: 0 (UAC disabled - security risk)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: 2 (Prompt for consent on secure desktop)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: 0 (Elevate without prompting - dangerous)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser: 3 (Prompt for credentials)"
    - "PromptOnSecureDesktop: 1 (Use secure desktop for prompts)"
    - "EnableInstallerDetection: 1 (Detect installation programs)"

limitations:
  - "UAC configuration does NOT prove privilege escalation attacks occurred"
  - "Disabled UAC settings don't indicate successful unauthorized elevation"
  - "Policy modifications may be legitimate administrative security adjustments"
  - "Prompt behavior settings don't prove bypass techniques were used"
  - "Configuration changes don't indicate actual privilege abuse happened"
  - "UAC settings may be enterprise-configured for operational requirements"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_bypass_proof:
    - "Event logs showing successful privilege escalation despite UAC settings"
    - "Process execution logs showing elevated processes launched without proper authorization"
    - "Registry changes showing unauthorized modifications during weakened UAC periods"
    - "File system artifacts showing administrative operations performed by standard users"
    - "Application logs showing successful bypass of UAC restrictions"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing UAC prompt suppression or bypass attempts"
    - "Process execution with administrative privileges during UAC configuration changes"
    - "Registry modifications in administrative areas during reduced UAC enforcement"
    - "File system access to protected areas correlating with UAC setting changes"
