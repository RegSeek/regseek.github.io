details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive event log configuration including maximum log sizes, retention 
    policies, enabled/disabled channels, log file locations, access permissions, and audit policy 
    settings. Controls logging behavior for Security, Application, System, Setup, and custom event 
    logs including modern Windows Event Log (EVTX) channels.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for forensic investigations as it reveals if attackers disabled logging to hide malicious 
    activity, modified log retention to prevent evidence preservation, or altered audit policies to 
    avoid detection. Shows evidence tampering attempts and insufficient logging configurations that 
    may result in missing evidence.

  structure: |
    EventLog service configuration includes log names as subkeys containing MaxSize (maximum bytes), 
    Retention (retention days), File (log file path), RestrictGuestAccess (access permissions), 
    and Sources (event sources). WINEVT Channels contain modern event log configuration with 
    Enabled status and MaxSize settings.

  examples:
    - "Security\\MaxSize: 0x6400000 (100MB maximum log size)"
    - "Security\\Retention: 0 (overwrite events as needed)"
    - "Application\\File: %SystemRoot%\\System32\\Winevt\\Logs\\Application.evtx"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational\\Enabled: 0 (PowerShell logging disabled)"
    - "Security\\RestrictGuestAccess: 1 (guest access restricted)"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\\MaxSize: 0x40000000 (1GB Sysmon log)"
    - "System\\AutoBackupLogFiles: 1 (automatic log backup enabled)"
    - "AuditLogonEvents: 0 (logon auditing disabled)"

limitations:
  - "Event log configuration does NOT prove logging tampering or evidence destruction occurred"
  - "Disabled logging channels don't indicate malicious activity caused the changes"
  - "Log size limits don't prove events were lost due to insufficient retention"
  - "Audit policy settings don't indicate actual audit events were generated"
  - "Configuration modifications may be legitimate administrative log management"
  - "Log retention settings don't prove evidence was intentionally destroyed"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_tampering_proof:
    - "Event logs showing configuration changes and log clearing events"
    - "Registry change logs showing event log configuration modifications"
    - "File system artifacts showing log file deletion or modification"
    - "Audit logs showing unauthorized access to event log configuration"
    - "Process execution logs showing log management utilities being run"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing gaps in logging during suspicious periods"
    - "Registry changes in audit policy settings correlating with attack timelines"
    - "File modifications in event log directories during configuration changes"
    - "Event logs showing log service restarts or configuration reloads"
