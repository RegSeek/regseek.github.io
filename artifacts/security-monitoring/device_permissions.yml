details:
  what: |
    Windows capability access manager controls application permissions for sensitive device resources 
    including camera, microphone, location services, contacts, calendar, messaging, and other 
    privacy-sensitive capabilities. Manages global and per-application granular access controls.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privacy violations, unauthorized surveillance, and data exfiltration 
    through device sensors. Shows applications with access to sensitive resources, reveals potential 
    surveillance capabilities, and indicates privacy setting modifications.

  structure: |
    ConsentStore organizes permissions by capability type with global and per-application settings. 
    DeviceAccess controls system-wide capability enablement, Privacy settings manage user-level 
    preferences, and AppPrivacy policies enforce enterprise privacy controls.

  examples:
    - "ConsentStore\\\\webcam\\\\Value: Allow (Global camera access enabled)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\microphone\\\\Value: Deny (Global microphone access disabled)"
    - "Microsoft.Camera_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\Value: Allow (Camera app access granted)"
    - "Skype_kzf8qxf38zg5c\\\\Value: Allow (Skype microphone and camera access)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\location\\\\Value: Deny (Location services disabled globally)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\contacts\\\\Value: Allow (Contact access permitted)"
    - "Global\\\\{E5323777-F976-4f5b-9B55-B94699C46E44}\\\\Value: Deny (Location disabled)"
    - "AppPrivacy\\\\LetAppsAccessCamera: 2 (Force deny camera access policy)"

limitations:
  - "Permission settings do NOT prove applications actually accessed sensitive data"
  - "Device capability allowances don't indicate what data was collected"
  - "Privacy consent doesn't prove surveillance or unauthorized access occurred"
  - "Location permissions don't indicate actual location tracking happened"
  - "Contact access permissions don't prove data exfiltration occurred"
  - "Capability settings may be legitimate privacy preferences"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_access_proof:
    - "Application logs showing successful data operations using granted permissions"
    - "Network traffic logs showing data transmission from apps with device permissions"
    - "File system artifacts showing data collected by applications"
    - "Process execution logs for applications during permission usage periods"
    - "Event logs showing successful device access operations"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents or files created by applications with sensitive permissions"
    - "Network connections by applications with location or contact access"
    - "Registry changes showing application data storage during permission usage"
    - "File modifications in application data folders during capability access"
