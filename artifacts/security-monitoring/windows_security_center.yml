details:
  what: |
    Windows Security Center provides centralized monitoring and reporting of security status 
    including firewall, antivirus, anti-spyware, and update status. Manages security provider 
    registration, user notification settings, security status aggregation, and health monitoring 
    for comprehensive system security oversight.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying attempts to hide security status from users, reveals disabled 
    security notifications that may indicate compromise, and shows registered security providers 
    that could be malicious software. Attackers often disable Security Center notifications 
    to prevent users from discovering security software disabling or malware presence.

  structure: |
    Security Center configuration includes monitoring settings for individual security categories, 
    provider registration data with capabilities and status information, notification policies, 
    and user interface control settings. Provider information stored with GUIDs, product names, 
    and security service capabilities.

  examples:
    - "SecurityCenter\\DisableNotifications: 1 (All notifications suppressed)"
    - "AntiVirusDisableNotify: 1 (Antivirus warnings disabled)"
    - "FirewallDisableNotify: 1 (Firewall notifications disabled)"
    - "UpdatesDisableNotify: 1 (Update notifications suppressed)"
    - "AntiVirusOverride: 1 (Security Center antivirus monitoring overridden)"
    - "HealthService\\HealthCheckSettings: [Binary configuration data]"
    - "Monitoring\\{GUID}: Security provider registration entry"
    - "UacDisableNotify: 1 (UAC notifications disabled)"

limitations:
  - "Security Center configuration does NOT prove security bypass attacks occurred"
  - "Disabled notifications don't indicate actual security software was compromised"
  - "Provider registration may include legitimate enterprise security tools"
  - "Configuration changes may be authorized administrative security adjustments"
  - "Suppressed warnings don't prove malicious activity was successfully hidden"
  - "Security status overrides may be for legitimate operational requirements"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_compromise_proof:
    - "Event logs showing actual security software disabling or malware execution"
    - "File system artifacts showing malicious software activity during disabled monitoring"
    - "Process execution logs showing security software tampering or malware execution"
    - "Registry changes showing security configuration modifications during attack periods"
    - "Application logs showing security provider failures or malicious registration"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing security status changes correlating with suspicious activity"
    - "Registry changes in security software configurations during notification disabling"
    - "File modifications in security provider directories during provider registration changes"
    - "Network logs showing malware communication during disabled security monitoring"
