details:
  what: |
    Windows Defender (Windows Security) configuration including real-time protection settings, 
    scan exclusions, threat detection policies, User Account Control (UAC) settings, and security 
    feature states. Controls system security posture and malware detection capabilities.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows if security features were disabled to facilitate malware execution, reveals exclusion 
    paths that attackers may have added, and indicates security policy modifications. Critical for 
    understanding security bypass techniques and assessing security posture during incidents.

  structure: |
    Defender settings include DisableAntiSpyware, DisableRealtimeMonitoring, scan exclusions, update 
    configurations, and threat response settings. UAC settings control elevation prompts and 
    administrator approval mode. Binary policy data controls feature enablement.

  examples:
    - "DisableAntiSpyware: 1 (Windows Defender disabled)"
    - "DisableRealtimeMonitoring: 1 (Real-time protection off)"
    - "ExclusionPath: C:\\Malware\\staging"
    - "ExclusionProcess: suspicious.exe"
    - "EnableLUA: 0 (UAC completely disabled)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: 0 (No UAC prompts)"
    - "ThreatSeverityDefaultAction: 6 (Allow all threats)"
    - "SubmitSamplesConsent: 2 (Never send samples)"

limitations:
  - "Security settings do NOT prove malware execution or successful attacks occurred"
  - "Disabled protection doesn't indicate actual threat exploitation happened"
  - "Exclusion paths may be legitimate software compatibility requirements"
  - "Configuration changes may be authorized administrative security adjustments"
  - "Security policy modifications don't prove malicious activity took place"
  - "UAC settings may be enterprise-configured for operational efficiency"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_compromise_proof:
    - "Event logs showing malware execution during disabled protection periods"
    - "File system artifacts showing malware activity in excluded paths"
    - "Process execution logs showing threats launched during weakened security"
    - "Network traffic logs showing malicious communication during disabled monitoring"
    - "Quarantine logs showing threats detected before security modifications"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Registry changes showing security setting modifications during attack timeframes"
    - "Event logs showing security feature disabling followed by suspicious activity"
    - "File modifications in excluded directories during security policy changes"
    - "Process execution with elevated privileges during UAC configuration changes"
