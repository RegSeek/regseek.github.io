details:
  what: |
    Windows Performance Toolkit configuration encompasses performance counter definitions, system 
    health monitoring, reliability tracking, performance data collection settings, and monitoring 
    service configurations. Controls system optimization metrics, performance baseline establishment, 
    and health tracking capabilities essential for system analysis and troubleshooting.

  forensic_value: |
    Performance monitoring can be disabled to hide malicious activity that would cause system 
    performance degradation, shows system health indicators that may reveal compromise, and provides 
    baseline information for detecting anomalous system behavior. Reliability data tracks application 
    crashes that could indicate malware activity.

  structure: |
    Performance library configuration includes counter definitions with Last Counter and Last Help 
    values, provider registration for performance data sources, collection intervals, and monitoring 
    service settings. Reliability tracking maintains system stability metrics and application crash data.

  examples:
    - "Perflib\\Last Counter: 1846 (Latest performance counter identifier)"
    - "Perflib\\Last Help: 1847 (Latest help text identifier)"
    - "PerfProc\\Collect Timeout: 10000 (Process data collection timeout)"
    - "Reliability\\TimeStampInterval: 1 (Reliability data collection frequency)"
    - "Performance\\Library: C:\\Windows\\System32\\perfproc.dll (Performance DLL)"
    - "DisablePerformanceCounters: 1 (Performance monitoring disabled)"
    - "PerfOS\\Open Timeout: 15000 (OS performance data timeout)"
    - "Collect: PerfProcCollect (Performance collection function)"

limitations:
  - "Performance monitoring configuration does NOT prove malicious activity occurred"
  - "Disabled performance counters don't indicate malware was actively hiding"
  - "System health metrics may be affected by legitimate system issues"
  - "Configuration changes may be for legitimate system optimization"
  - "Reliability data doesn't prove crashes were caused by malicious software"
  - "Performance settings may be modified for operational rather than malicious reasons"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_impact_proof:
    - "Actual performance monitoring data showing system degradation during attack periods"
    - "Event logs showing performance counter modifications and monitoring service changes"
    - "Process execution logs showing resource-intensive malicious applications"
    - "File system artifacts showing performance data collection and analysis results"
    - "Registry changes showing performance configuration modifications during suspicious periods"

    - "System resource usage logs showing abnormal activity patterns"
    - "Event logs showing application crashes and system instability"
    - "Registry changes in related system monitoring configurations during attack timeframes"
    - "File modifications in performance monitoring directories during configuration changes"
