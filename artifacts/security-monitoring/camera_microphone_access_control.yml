details:
  what: |
    Windows manages application permissions for camera and microphone access through the Capability 
    Access Manager. Registry stores consent decisions, application-specific permissions, system-wide 
    privacy settings, and usage tracking for audio/video recording capabilities.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privacy violations, unauthorized surveillance, and potential malware 
    with recording capabilities. Shows applications attempting camera/microphone access, privacy 
    setting modifications, and provides timeline of when sensitive permissions were granted or denied.

  structure: |
    ConsentStore entries include Value (Allow/Deny), LastUsedTimeStart/LastUsedTimeStop timestamps 
    as FILETIME, and application-specific permission entries with package family names for UWP apps 
    and executable paths for desktop applications.

  examples:
    - "microphone\\Value: Allow (System-wide microphone access enabled)"
    - "webcam\\Value: Deny (System-wide camera access disabled)"
    - "microphone\\Microsoft.SkypeApp_kzf8qxf38zg5c\\Value: Allow (Skype microphone permission)"
    - "webcam\\C:\\Program Files\\Zoom\\bin\\Zoom.exe\\Value: Allow (Zoom camera permission)"
    - "LastUsedTimeStart: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: Last camera access)"
    - "LastUsedTimeStop: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: Camera access ended)"

limitations:
  - "Permission grants do NOT prove actual camera or microphone usage occurred"
  - "Access consent doesn't indicate what was recorded or captured"
  - "Usage timestamps may reflect permission checks, not actual recording"
  - "Application permissions don't prove unauthorized surveillance happened"
  - "System-wide settings may be overridden by specific application permissions"
  - "Permission modifications could be from legitimate privacy adjustments"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_surveillance_proof:
    - "Audio/video files created during permission usage timeframes"
    - "Application logs showing successful camera/microphone operations"
    - "Process execution logs for applications with permissions during usage times"
    - "Network traffic logs if recorded content was transmitted"
    - "File system artifacts showing media files created by permitted applications"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing application launches during permission usage windows"
    - "Registry changes in application-specific settings during permission grants"
    - "File modifications in application data folders during usage periods"
    - "Network connections by applications with recording permissions"
