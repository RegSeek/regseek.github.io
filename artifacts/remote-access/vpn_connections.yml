details:
  what: |
    Windows VPN connection profiles, dial-up settings, and remote access service configurations.
    Includes server addresses, authentication methods, encryption protocols, and connection
    parameters for various VPN protocols (PPTP, L2TP/IPSec, SSTP, IKEv2).

  forensic_value: |
    Shows remote network access attempts and VPN usage for potential data exfiltration.
    Can reveal connections to suspicious networks, command and control infrastructure, or
    anonymization services. Critical for identifying covert communication channels and
    unauthorized network access attempts.

  structure: |
    Connection profiles with server addresses, authentication settings, VPN protocols,
    encryption configurations, and credential storage options. Phonebook entries contain
    detailed connection parameters and protocol-specific settings stored in binary format.

  examples:
    - "Connection: Corporate VPN"
    - "Server: vpn.company.com"
    - "Protocol: L2TP/IPSec"
    - "Authentication: MS-CHAPv2"
    - "PreSharedKey: [encrypted]"
    - "Tunnel: 192.168.100.1"
    - "Suspicious: Connection: TorVPN-Exit"
    - "Anonymization: Server: vpn.privacy-service.onion"
    - "AutoConnect: 1 (automatic connection)"
    - "SaveCredentials: 1 (credentials stored)"

limitations:
  - "VPN configuration profiles do NOT prove connections were established"
  - "Connection settings don't indicate successful authentication or data transmission"
  - "Server addresses don't prove network traffic actually used the VPN"
  - "Credential storage doesn't indicate VPN was used for data transfer"
  - "Auto-connect settings don't show when connections occurred"
  - "Protocol settings don't reveal what data was transmitted through VPN"
  - "Connection profiles may exist without any actual VPN usage"
