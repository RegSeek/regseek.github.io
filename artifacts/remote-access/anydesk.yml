details:
  what: |
    AnyDesk remote desktop configuration including connection settings, security configurations, 
    address book management, and session preferences. Registry stores installation data, 
    access permissions, and authentication settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating remote access activities, potential unauthorized system control, 
    and technical support sessions. Shows evidence of remote desktop usage, connection patterns, 
    and can indicate legitimate remote work, unauthorized access attempts, or potential command and control communications.

  structure: |
    AnyDesk configuration includes connection preferences, security settings, address book entries, 
    access permissions, and session management options. Connection data tracks partner devices 
    and access control configurations.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\AnyDesk"
    - "AnyDeskID: 123456789 (Unique device identifier)"
    - "AddressBook: Work-Computer-987654321"
    - "UnattendedAccess: 1 (Permanent access enabled)"
    - "Password: (Encrypted connection password)"
    - "FileTransfer: 1 (File transfer capability enabled)"
    - "AudioTransmission: 1 (Audio streaming enabled)"
    - "ClipboardSync: 1 (Clipboard synchronization active)"

limitations:
  - "AnyDesk configuration does NOT prove remote sessions actually occurred"
  - "Address book entries don't indicate successful connections were made"
  - "Unattended access settings don't prove remote control was used"
  - "File transfer capabilities don't show what files were transferred"
  - "Password configuration doesn't indicate authentication success"
  - "Installation presence doesn't prove active remote desktop usage"
  - "Security settings may be configured without actual remote sessions"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing AnyDesk.exe launches and remote session processes"
    - "Network logs showing AnyDesk protocol connections to remote systems"
    - "AnyDesk connection logs showing actual remote session establishment"
    - "File system artifacts showing files accessed during remote sessions"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing user logon/logoff during remote sessions"
    - "Recent documents accessed during suspected remote control timeframes"
    - "Clipboard artifacts showing data transfer between systems"
