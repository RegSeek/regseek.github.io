details:
  what: |
    TeamViewer configuration including connection preferences, security settings, account
    integration, and access control policies. Stores configuration data, connection history,
    authentication methods, and collaboration settings for remote access analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating remote access activities and unauthorized system access.
    Shows evidence of remote desktop usage, connection patterns, and access permissions.
    Can indicate unauthorized remote access, insider collaboration, external technical
    support, or potential command and control activities.

  structure: |
    TeamViewer configuration includes account credentials, connection settings, security
    policies, and access permissions. Connection data tracks remote session history,
    partner information, and access control settings stored in registry values.

  examples:

limitations:
  - "Configuration settings do NOT prove TeamViewer sessions actually occurred"
  - "Connection history may not show complete session details or duration"
  - "Account settings don't indicate actual remote access usage"
  - "File transfer enablement doesn't prove files were transferred"
  - "Unattended access settings don't show when remote access happened"
  - "TeamViewer ID presence doesn't prove remote connections were established"
  - "Security settings can be bypassed or modified by remote operators"
