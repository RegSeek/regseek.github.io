details:
  what: |
    Terminal Services configuration for remote desktop sessions, console sessions, and multi-user
    environments. Controls session behavior, timeouts, security settings, and application execution
    in terminal sessions. Manages both incoming remote connections and outgoing client configurations.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows remote session configuration that could facilitate unauthorized access, reveals session
    policies that might hide user activity, and indicates terminal services usage for remote
    command execution or lateral movement. Critical for identifying unauthorized remote access
    and RDP-based attacks.

  structure: |
    WinStations configuration includes session settings, security descriptors, and connection
    parameters. Install settings control application compatibility in multi-user environments.
    Client settings track connection preferences and recently connected servers.

  examples:

limitations:
  - "Terminal Services configuration does NOT prove remote sessions occurred"
  - "Session settings don't indicate actual user activity or authentication"
  - "RDP port configuration doesn't show successful connections"
  - "Client settings don't prove connections were established"
  - "Timeout settings don't indicate actual session duration"
  - "Application compatibility settings don't show software was used"
  - "Security settings can be bypassed or modified"
