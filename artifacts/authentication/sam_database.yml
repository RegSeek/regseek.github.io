details:
  what: |
    Security Account Manager (SAM) database stores comprehensive local user account information 
    including usernames, NTLM password hashes, account policies, logon counts, last logon times, 
    password change dates, and account lockout information for local authentication management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying unauthorized accounts, password attack evidence, account creation 
    timelines, and authentication patterns during security incidents. Password hashes enable 
    offline password cracking for credential recovery and privilege escalation analysis.

  structure: |
    User accounts organized by Relative Identifier (RID) starting from 500 for built-in accounts. 
    Binary data structures contain NTLM password hashes, account creation timestamps, last logon 
    times, logon counts, bad password attempts, and account flags.

  examples:
    - "RID 500: Built-in Administrator account (Default system administrator)"
    - "RID 1001: Local user account (First user-created account)"
    - "Username: administrator (Account name in Names subkey)"
    - "NTLM Hash: aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0"
    - "Last Logon: 2024-01-15 14:30:25 UTC (Most recent authentication)"
    - "Password Last Set: 2024-01-01 08:00:00 UTC (Password change timestamp)"
    - "Logon Count: 157 (Total successful authentications)"
    - "Bad Password Count: 3 (Failed authentication attempts)"

limitations:
  - "SAM data does NOT prove successful password cracking occurred"
  - "Account creation timestamps don't prove unauthorized account usage"
  - "Password hashes may be strong and resistant to cracking attempts"
  - "Logon statistics don't indicate the nature or authorization of access"
  - "Account metadata doesn't prove actual compromise or malicious activity"
  - "Bad password counts may reflect legitimate forgotten password attempts"
