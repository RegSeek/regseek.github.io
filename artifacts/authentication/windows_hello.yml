details:
  what: |
    Windows Hello biometric authentication system encompasses fingerprint reader configuration, 
    facial recognition settings, iris scanning support, PIN complexity requirements, and enterprise 
    policy enforcement. Controls biometric enrollment processes and passwordless authentication capabilities.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding authentication mechanisms that may affect system access, reveals 
    biometric enrollment indicating user presence and device usage patterns, and shows enterprise 
    authentication policies. May reveal attempts to bypass biometric authentication.

  structure: |
    WinBio configuration includes biometric service settings, enrolled user information, sensor 
    configuration, and policy enforcement. PassportForWork contains PIN policies, biometric 
    requirements, and enterprise authentication settings. DeviceLock manages screen lock behavior.

    - "WinBio\\DatabaseConnections: Biometric database configuration"
    - "EnrolledUsers: S-1-5-21-xxx-1001 (User SID with biometric enrollment)"
    - "RequireBiometrics: 1 (Biometric authentication required)"
    - "PIN\\MinimumLength: 6 (Minimum PIN length requirement)"
    - "PIN\\MaximumLength: 127 (Maximum PIN length allowed)"
    - "PIN\\RequireDigits: 1 (PIN must contain numbers)"
    - "FacialRecognition: 1 (Windows Hello face authentication enabled)"
    - "FingerprintReader: Microsoft Fingerprint Reader (Biometric device)"

limitations:
  - "Biometric enrollment does NOT prove successful authentication occurred"
  - "Hello configuration doesn't indicate actual biometric usage for system access"
  - "PIN policy settings don't prove weak PIN credentials are in use"
  - "Biometric hardware configuration doesn't indicate authentication bypass attempts"
  - "Enrollment records may be from initial setup without indicating ongoing usage"
  - "Authentication configuration may be enterprise-mandated rather than user-selected"
