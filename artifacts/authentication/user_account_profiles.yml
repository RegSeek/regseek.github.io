details:
  what: |
    Windows stores user account information including Security Identifiers (SIDs), profile 
    directory paths, account creation timestamps, last logon times, and account properties. 
    Maintains both active and historical account data for local and domain users.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for multi-user system analysis and identifying all accounts that accessed 
    the system. Critical for insider threat investigations, privilege escalation analysis, 
    and linking forensic artifacts to specific user accounts.

  structure: |
    ProfileList contains user SIDs as subkeys with ProfileImagePath, State, RefCount, and 
    Flags. SAM database stores account creation times, last logon times, login counts, and 
    account flags. Names subkey provides SID-to-username mappings.

  examples:
    - "S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1001\\ProfileImagePath: C:\\Users\\Administrator"
    - "S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1002\\ProfileImagePath: C:\\Users\\jdoe"
    - "State: 0 (Active profile loaded successfully)"
    - "RefCount: 1 (Profile currently in use)"
    - "Flags: 0 (Standard user profile)"
    - "Account Created: 2024-01-15 08:00:00 UTC"
    - "Last Logon: 2024-01-20 14:30:25 UTC"
    - "Login Count: 157 (total successful logons)"
    - "Names\\Administrator: S-1-5-21-xxx-500"

limitations:
  - "Account creation timestamp does NOT prove when account was first used"
  - "Last logon time may not reflect actual user activity"
  - "Profile path existence doesn't prove user logged in successfully"
  - "Login count shows authentication attempts, not successful sessions"
  - "Domain accounts may have limited local registry presence"
  - "Account metadata doesn't prove user performed specific actions"
  - "Profile loading doesn't indicate actual user interaction"
