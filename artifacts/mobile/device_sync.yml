details:
  what: |
    Windows mobile device integration encompasses Cross-Device Platform (CDP) configuration,
    device synchronization settings, Your Phone app connections, Bluetooth device pairing,
    notification mirroring, and cross-platform continuity features. Manages smartphone
    integration, tablet connectivity, and multi-device user experience through Windows
    ecosystem integration and third-party mobile device management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating cross-device data synchronization, mobile device access to
    corporate resources, and potential data exfiltration through mobile integration features.
    Shows evidence of paired mobile devices, synchronization activities, notification sharing,
    and cross-platform file access. Essential for understanding mobile attack vectors,
    BYOD policy violations, and multi-device security incidents.

  structure: |
    CDP configuration includes device discovery settings, paired device information, sync
    preferences, and cross-device communication protocols. DeviceAccess controls mobile
    device permissions, notification access, and feature sharing. WINEVT channels track
    device synchronization events and connection history with mobile devices.
