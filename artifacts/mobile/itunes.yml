details:
  what: |
    iTunes for Windows manages Apple device synchronization including iPhone, iPad,
    and iPod connections, backup locations, media library sync, and device management.
    Registry stores device identifiers, backup paths, sync preferences, and media
    library configurations for comprehensive Apple ecosystem integration and
    cross-platform data synchronization between Windows and Apple devices.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating mobile device connections, data synchronization
    between Windows and Apple devices, backup locations containing mobile device
    data, and evidence of Apple device usage patterns. Shows evidence of mobile
    device ownership, sync activity, backup creation, and can reveal access to
    mobile device data through iTunes backups and synchronization.

  structure: |
    iTunes configuration includes device registration data, backup storage paths,
    sync preferences, media library locations, and Apple ID authentication.
    Mobile Device Support entries track connected devices, device capabilities,
    and synchronization history for comprehensive Apple device interaction analysis.

  examples:
    - "StoreAccountName: user@icloud.com (Associated Apple ID)"
    - "LastBackupPath: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup"
    - "DeviceID: 1234567890abcdef (Connected device identifier)"
    - "DeviceName: John's iPhone (User device name)"
    - "BackupDirectory: {device-guid} (Device-specific backup folder)"
    - "SyncLibrary: 1 (Music library synchronization enabled)"
    - "AutoSync: 0 (Automatic sync disabled)"
