details:
  what: |
    Windows virtualization infrastructure includes Hyper-V hypervisor configuration,
    virtual machine management service settings, container runtime support, and
    security features including Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) and Device Guard.
    Controls hypervisor operation, VM isolation, and virtualization-enhanced security.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtualization-based attacks, VM escape attempts,
    container security incidents, and virtualization technology abuse for malware
    evasion. Shows evidence of virtual machine usage that could hide malicious
    activity and indicates attempts to bypass security controls through virtualization.

  structure: |
    Virtualization configuration includes hypervisor enablement status, VM management
    service settings, virtual switch configurations, and security policy enforcement.
    DeviceGuard contains Virtualization-Based Security settings, hypervisor-protected
    code integrity, and credential guard configurations.

  examples:
    - "Virtualization\\HypervisorEnforced: 1 (Hypervisor-based security active)"
    - "vmms\\Start: 3 (Virtual Machine Management Service - manual start)"
    - "Hyper-V\\EnabledState: 1 (Hyper-V feature enabled)"
    - "DeviceGuard\\EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity: 1 (VBS enabled)"
    - "DeviceGuard\\RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures: 1 (Secure boot required)"
    - "HyperVGeneration: 2 (Generation 2 VM support)"
    - "ContainerFeature: 1 (Windows container support enabled)"
    - "VirtualizationExtensions: 1 (Hardware virtualization available)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows feature enablement only, not actual VM creation or usage"
  - "Hyper-V enabled doesn't prove virtual machines were actively used"
  - "VBS settings show configuration, not actual security enforcement activity"
  - "Service settings don't indicate VM management operations occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "Hyper-V event logs showing VM operations"
    - "Virtual machine files (.vhd, .vhdx, .vmcx)"
    - "Process execution logs showing vmms.exe activity"
    - "File system artifacts showing VM storage locations"
    - "Network logs showing virtual switch traffic"
