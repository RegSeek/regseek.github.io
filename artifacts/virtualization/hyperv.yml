details:
  what: |
    Windows virtualization infrastructure encompasses Hyper-V hypervisor configuration, virtual
    machine management service settings, container runtime support, hardware virtualization
    capabilities, and security features including Virtualization-Based Security (VBS) and
    Device Guard. Controls hypervisor operation, VM isolation, container orchestration,
    and virtualization-enhanced security mechanisms for enterprise and development environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtualization-based attacks, VM escape attempts, container
    security incidents, and virtualization technology abuse for malware evasion. Shows
    evidence of virtual machine usage that could hide malicious activity, reveals virtualization
    configurations that may facilitate advanced persistent threats, and indicates attempts
    to bypass security controls through virtualization technologies.

  structure: |
    Virtualization configuration includes hypervisor enablement status, VM management service
    settings, virtual switch configurations, security policy enforcement, and hardware
    virtualization capabilities. DeviceGuard contains Virtualization-Based Security settings,
    hypervisor-protected code integrity, and credential guard configurations for enhanced security.
