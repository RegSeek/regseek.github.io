details:
  what: |
    Docker Desktop Windows integration settings including installation paths, basic configuration 
    preferences, and Windows-specific integration options. Note: Docker primarily stores 
    operational data (containers, images, networks) in JSON configuration files and databases 
    in %APPDATA%\Docker, not in the Windows registry.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating containerized application development, potential isolation bypass 
    attempts, and container-based malware analysis. Shows evidence of container usage, image downloads, 
    and can reveal container-based data exfiltration or isolated development activities.

  structure: |
    Registry contains basic Docker Desktop installation information, Windows integration settings, 
    and file associations. Operational container data (images, containers, networks, volumes) 
    is stored in Docker's JSON configuration files in the user's AppData directory, not in the Windows registry.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker\\Docker Desktop.exe"
    - "Version: Docker Desktop 4.25.0"
    - "FileAssociation: .dockerfile -> Docker Desktop"
    - "ProtocolHandler: docker:// (Docker protocol registration)"
    - "WSLIntegration: 1 (Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled)"
    - "Note: Container runtime settings are in JSON files at %APPDATA%\\Docker\\settings.json"
    - "Note: Container images stored in virtual disk files, not registry"

limitations:
  - "Docker registry entries do NOT prove containers were created or executed"
  - "Installation presence doesn't indicate active container development or deployment"
  - "Registry entries do NOT contain container runtime data, images, or configuration"
  - "File associations don't prove Docker was actively used for container operations"
  - "Registry settings only show Windows integration, not actual Docker operations"
  - "Actual container data is stored in JSON files and virtual disks, not in Windows registry"
  - "WSL integration settings don't show Linux containers were run or what they contained"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Docker daemon logs showing container creation and execution"
    - "Process execution logs showing docker.exe commands"
    - "File system artifacts showing Docker images and container files"
