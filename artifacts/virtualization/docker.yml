details:
  what: |
    Docker Desktop configuration for container development including container creation, 
    image management, volume mounting, and network configuration. Registry stores installation 
    settings, runtime preferences, and resource allocations.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating containerized application development, potential isolation bypass 
    attempts, and container-based malware analysis. Shows evidence of container usage, image downloads, 
    and can reveal container-based data exfiltration or isolated development activities.

  structure: |
    Docker Desktop configuration includes installation paths, resource settings, container runtime 
    preferences, volume mount configurations, and network settings. Container registry tracks 
    image repositories and development workflows.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\Docker\\Docker\\Docker Desktop.exe"
    - "ResourceSettings: CPUs=4, Memory=8GB"
    - "EnableKubernetesCluster: 1 (Kubernetes integration enabled)"
    - "ShareDrives: C:\\ (Host drive sharing enabled)"
    - "FileSharing: C:\\Development (Shared development directory)"
    - "ProxySettings: http://proxy.company.com:8080"
    - "WSL2Backend: 1 (Windows Subsystem for Linux backend)"

limitations:
  - "Docker registry configuration does NOT prove containers were created or executed"
  - "Installation presence doesn't indicate active container development or deployment"
  - "Resource allocation settings don't show what containers actually used resources"
  - "File sharing configuration doesn't prove files were shared with containers"
  - "Drive sharing settings don't indicate data was accessed from containers"
  - "Kubernetes integration settings don't prove orchestration was used"
  - "WSL2 backend configuration doesn't show Linux containers were run"
