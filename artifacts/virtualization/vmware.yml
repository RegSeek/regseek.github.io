details:
  what: |
    VMware Workstation and Player manage desktop virtualization including virtual
    machine creation, hardware configuration, network settings, and hypervisor
    management. Registry stores VM configurations, licensing information, performance
    settings, and virtual hardware preferences for comprehensive virtualization
    platform analysis and virtual environment management tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtual machine usage, potential evidence isolation,
    malware analysis environments, and sophisticated attack techniques using
    virtualization. Shows evidence of VM creation, configuration changes, virtual
    network setups, and can indicate attempts to hide activities through virtualization
    or use of isolated environments for malicious purposes.

  structure: |
    VMware configuration includes virtual machine paths, hardware settings, network
    configurations, licensing data, and performance preferences. VM registry entries
    track virtual hardware assignments, snapshot locations, and isolation settings
    for comprehensive virtualization behavior analysis and security assessment.
