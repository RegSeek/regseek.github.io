details:
  what: |
    Windows Subsystem for Linux enables running Linux distributions natively on Windows through
    compatibility layer technology. Registry configuration includes installed distributions,
    default distribution settings, user mappings, file system interoperability, network
    configuration, and development environment preferences for Linux development on Windows.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating Linux-based attack tools, cross-platform malware, development
    environment abuse, and sophisticated attacks that leverage Linux capabilities within Windows.
    Shows evidence of Linux tool usage, script execution, container operations, and potential
    security bypasses through Linux environment. Essential for advanced persistent threat
    investigations involving cross-platform attack techniques.

  structure: |
    WSL configuration includes DefaultDistribution (default Linux distro), installed distribution
    metadata, user ID mappings, interoperability settings, and file system mount configurations.
    Distribution entries contain installation paths, kernel versions, default user settings,
    and distribution-specific configuration for comprehensive Linux environment management.

  examples:
    - "DefaultDistribution: Ubuntu-20.04 (Default Linux distribution)"
    - "Distribution: {12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc} Ubuntu installation"
    - "DefaultUid: 1000 (Default Linux user ID)"
    - "DistributionName: kali-linux (Penetration testing distribution)"
    - "BasePath: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04onWindows"
    - "PackageFamilyName: CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc"
    - "State: 1 (Distribution installed and running)"
    - "Version: 2 (WSL 2 with Linux kernel)"
