details:
  what: |
    Windows Subsystem for Linux enables running Linux distributions natively on Windows
    through compatibility layer technology. Registry configuration includes installed
    distributions, default distribution settings, user mappings, file system
    interoperability, and network configuration.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating Linux-based attack tools, cross-platform malware,
    development environment abuse, and sophisticated attacks that leverage Linux
    capabilities within Windows. Shows evidence of Linux tool usage and potential
    security bypasses through Linux environment.

  structure: |
    WSL configuration includes DefaultDistribution (default Linux distro), installed
    distribution metadata, user ID mappings, interoperability settings, and file
    system mount configurations. Distribution entries contain installation paths,
    kernel versions, and default user settings.

  examples:
    - "DefaultDistribution: Ubuntu-20.04 (Default Linux distribution)"
    - "Distribution: {12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc} Ubuntu installation"
    - "DefaultUid: 1000 (Default Linux user ID)"
    - "DistributionName: kali-linux (Penetration testing distribution)"
    - "BasePath: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04onWindows"
    - "PackageFamilyName: CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu20.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc"
    - "State: 1 (Distribution installed and running)"
    - "Version: 2 (WSL 2 with Linux kernel)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows installed distributions only, not actual Linux command execution"
  - "Distribution presence doesn't prove Linux tools were actively used"
  - "WSL configuration doesn't indicate specific commands or scripts run"
  - "State values show installation status, not usage patterns or frequency"
  - "Kali Linux installation suggests penetration testing but doesn't prove malicious activity"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "WSL process execution logs showing actual Linux command activity"
    - "Linux command history files within WSL distributions"
    - "File system artifacts showing Linux tool execution"
    - "Network traffic logs showing connections from WSL processes"
    - "PowerShell or cmd logs showing wsl.exe invocations"
