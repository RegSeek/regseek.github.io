details:
  what: |
    Oracle VirtualBox manages free desktop virtualization including virtual machine
    creation, hardware emulation, network configuration, and hypervisor management.
    Registry stores VM definitions, guest operating system configurations, shared
    folder settings, snapshot management, and virtualization preferences for
    comprehensive open-source virtualization platform analysis and virtual environment tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtual machine usage in security research, malware
    analysis, evidence isolation, and potential evasion techniques using free
    virtualization software. Shows evidence of VM creation, guest OS installations,
    network isolation setups, and can indicate attempts to conceal activities
    through virtualized environments or use VMs for malicious testing and analysis.

  structure: |
    VirtualBox configuration includes virtual machine registry data, guest additions
    status, network adapter settings, shared folder configurations, and snapshot
    information. VM entries track hardware allocations, ISO mounting history, and
    virtual device assignments for comprehensive VirtualBox usage analysis and security assessment.
