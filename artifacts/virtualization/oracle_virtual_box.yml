details:
  what: |
    Oracle VirtualBox manages free desktop virtualization including virtual machine
    creation, hardware emulation, network configuration, and hypervisor management.
    Registry stores VM definitions, guest operating system configurations, shared
    folder settings, and snapshot management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating virtual machine usage in security research, malware
    analysis, evidence isolation, and potential evasion techniques using free
    virtualization software. Shows evidence of VM creation, guest OS installations,
    and network isolation setups that could conceal activities.

  structure: |
    VirtualBox configuration includes virtual machine registry data, guest additions
    status, network adapter settings, shared folder configurations, and snapshot
    information. VM entries track hardware allocations, ISO mounting history,
    and virtual device assignments.

  examples:
    - "InstallDir: C:\\Program Files\\Oracle\\VirtualBox"
    - "Version: 7.0.12 (VirtualBox version)"
    - "Default Machine Folder: C:\\Users\\user\\VirtualBox VMs"
    - "RecentVMList: Windows_10_Test, Kali_Linux_Pen_Test"
    - "HostOnlyNetworking: vboxnet0 (Host-only network interface)"
    - "SharedFolders: Downloads -> C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads"
    - "GuestAdditionsInstalled: 1 (Guest additions present)"
    - "SnapshotFolder: C:\\VMs\\Snapshots (VM snapshot storage)"

  tools:
    - name: "Oracle VirtualBox Manager"

    - name: "VBoxManage"

    - name: "Registry Explorer"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual VM usage or guest OS activity"
  - "Recent VM list doesn't prove virtual machines were actively used"
  - "Shared folder mappings don't indicate actual file transfers occurred"
  - "Guest additions presence doesn't prove VM integration was used"
  - "Kali Linux VMs suggest penetration testing but don't prove malicious activity"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "VirtualBox log files showing actual VM operations"
    - "Virtual machine disk files (.vdi, .vmdk, .vhd)"
    - "Process execution logs showing VirtualBox.exe activity"
    - "File system artifacts in shared folder locations"
    - "Network traffic logs showing VM communications"

    - "Timeline analysis of VM creation and configuration changes"
