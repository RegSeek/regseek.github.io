details:
  what: |
    Windows container infrastructure includes Docker Desktop configuration, Windows container
    runtime settings, container isolation policies, image management, and networking
    configuration. Controls container execution environment, resource allocation,
    and security boundaries for modern application deployment.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating containerized malware, container escape attempts,
    unauthorized container deployments, and container-based data exfiltration.
    Shows evidence of container usage that could hide malicious activity and
    indicates attempts to bypass security controls through container technologies.

  structure: |
    Container configuration includes runtime policies, isolation modes (process vs. Hyper-V),
    network settings, storage drivers, security contexts, and resource constraints.
    Docker Desktop settings control daemon configuration, experimental features,
    and resource allocation.

  examples:
    - "ContainerManager\\IsolationMode: 1 (Process isolation enabled)"
    - "containerd\\Start: 3 (Container runtime service - manual startup)"
    - "Docker Desktop\\Settings\\SharedDrives: C,D (Host drive mapping)"
    - "Docker Desktop\\ExperimentalFeatures: true (Experimental features enabled)"
    - "Containers\\Runtime: Docker (Container runtime provider)"
    - "NetworkingMode: NAT (Network Address Translation mode)"
    - "StorageDriver: windowsfilter (Windows container storage driver)"
    - "SecurityOptions: privileged (Privileged container execution allowed)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual container deployments or activity"
  - "Container settings don't prove malicious containers were actually run"
  - "Experimental features may be enabled but not actively used"
  - "Privileged access settings don't indicate actual privilege abuse"
  - "Shared drive mappings don't prove data exfiltration occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "Docker daemon logs showing actual container operations"
    - "Container images and running container processes"
    - "File system artifacts showing container-related files"
    - "Network traffic logs showing container communications"
    - "Process execution logs showing Docker/containerd activity"
