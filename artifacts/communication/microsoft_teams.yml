details:
  what: |
    Microsoft Teams Desktop Client manages enterprise communication including chat,
    video conferencing, file sharing, and collaboration workspace integration.
    Registry stores user authentication, tenant configurations, meeting settings,
    notification preferences, and integration with Office 365 and Microsoft 365
    services for comprehensive workplace collaboration and communication management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating internal communications, unauthorized external contacts,
    data sharing through Teams channels, and evidence of collaboration activities.
    Shows evidence of Teams usage patterns, tenant memberships, external meeting
    participation, and potential data exfiltration through Teams file sharing and
    communication channels in enterprise environments.

  structure: |
    Teams configuration includes tenant identifiers, user principal names, meeting
    policies, chat settings, file sharing permissions, and device integration
    preferences. Enterprise policies control external access, guest permissions,
    and data governance compliance for comprehensive Teams security management.

    - "AllowGuestAccess: 1 (Guest users allowed in meetings)"
    - "RecordingPolicy: Enabled (Meeting recording allowed)"
