  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive version identification information including build numbers,
    edition details, installation timestamps, product keys, registered owner information,
    update history, and licensing data. Provides complete system identification for baseline
    establishment, vulnerability assessment, and forensic system profiling across different
    Windows versions and editions with detailed metadata for investigation correlation.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for establishing system baseline information, determining available Windows
    features and security capabilities, validating system timeline accuracy, and identifying
    Windows editions for capability analysis during investigations. Version information
    enables vulnerability assessment, helps correlate with known exploits, and provides
    context for available security features, installed updates, and system configuration
    options relevant to investigation scenarios.

  structure: |
    Version information stored as REG_SZ strings and REG_DWORD values including ProductName
    (Windows edition), CurrentBuild (build number), ReleaseId (version identifier), InstallDate
    (Unix timestamp), RegisteredOwner (system owner), DigitalProductId (license data), and
    update information with installation tracking and feature update history for comprehensive
    system identification and timeline establishment.

  examples:
    - "ProductName: Windows 11 Pro (Operating system edition)"
    - "ProductName: Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC (Long-term servicing channel)"
    - "CurrentBuild: 22621 (Windows 11 22H2 build number)"
    - "CurrentBuild: 19044 (Windows 10 21H2 build number)"
    - "ReleaseId: 22H2 (Feature update identifier)"
    - "InstallDate: 0x63A1B2C0 (Unix timestamp: 1671450304 = December 19, 2022)"
    - "RegisteredOwner: CORPORATE\\ITDepartment (System registration information)"
    - "RegisteredOrganization: Acme Corporation (Organization registration)"
    - "DigitalProductId: [Binary license and product key data]"
