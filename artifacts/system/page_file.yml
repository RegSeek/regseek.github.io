details:
  what: |
    Virtual memory and page file configuration controls how Windows manages memory when physical
    RAM is insufficient. Settings include page file locations, size limits, memory management
    parameters, virtual address space configuration, and swap file behavior. Manages memory
    allocation policies, paging algorithms, and virtual memory security settings for optimal
    system performance and memory utilization across different workload scenarios.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for memory forensics as page files contain sensitive data including passwords,
    encryption keys, process memory, and document contents that persist after process termination.
    Page file security settings reveal if sensitive data clearing was disabled, enabling forensic
    memory recovery. Configuration changes may indicate attempts to hide memory artifacts or
    optimize system performance for malicious activities requiring intensive memory usage.

  structure: |
    Memory Management contains PagingFiles (page file configuration string), ClearPageFileAtShutdown
    (security setting for data erasure), ExistingPageFiles (current active page files),
    SessionPoolSize (session memory allocation), SystemPages (system memory configuration),
    and DisablePagingExecutive (kernel memory paging control) stored as REG_SZ and REG_DWORD values.

  examples:
    - "PagingFiles: C:\\\\pagefile.sys 2048 4096 (2GB initial, 4GB maximum)"
    - "ClearPageFileAtShutdown: 0 (Pagefile not cleared - potential data recovery)"
    - "ExistingPageFiles: \\\\??\\\\C:\\\\pagefile.sys (Active page file location)"
    - "SessionPoolSize: 192 (Session pool memory allocation in MB)"
    - "SystemPages: 0 (System uses default page table size)"
    - "DisablePagingExecutive: 1 (Kernel memory not paged - security enhancement)"
    - "PagingFiles: D:\\\\swap.sys 8192 16384 (Custom location with larger size)"
