details:
  what: |
    Software Restriction Policies (SRP) provide legacy application control mechanisms that
    preceded AppLocker in Windows environments. Controls software execution based on path rules,
    hash rules, certificate rules, and network zone rules with configurable security levels.
    Provides basic application whitelisting capabilities, execution restrictions, and software
    control policies for older Windows systems and backward compatibility scenarios.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting legacy security policy bypass attempts, identifying software
    restrictions that may have been circumvented by attackers, and analyzing application
    control failures that enabled malware execution. Shows evidence of policy modifications
    designed to allow unauthorized software execution, reveals legitimate software lists
    that indicate system purpose, and provides insight into security posture weaknesses
    that attackers may have exploited.

  structure: |
    CodeIdentifiers configuration includes DefaultLevel (default security restriction level),
    ExecutableTypes (file extensions subject to restrictions), TransparentEnabled (policy
    enforcement mode), and rule collections for specific paths, hashes, certificates, and
    network zones. Security levels range from Disallowed (blocked) to Unrestricted (allowed)
    with intermediate Basic User and Constrained levels for granular control.

  examples:
    - "DefaultLevel: 0x00040000 (Unrestricted - allow all software execution)"
    - "DefaultLevel: 0x00000000 (Disallowed - block all software by default)"
    - "ExecutableTypes: ADE;ADP;BAS;BAT;CHM;CMD;COM;CPL;CRT;EXE;HLP;HTA;INF;INS;ISP;LNK;MDB;MDE;MSC;MSI;MSP;MST;OCX;PCD;PIF;REG;SCR;SHS;URL;VB;WSC;WSF;WSH"
    - "TransparentEnabled: 1 (Enforce policies for all users)"
    - "PolicyScope: 0 (Apply to all software)"
    - "PathRules\\0\\Description: Unrestricted access for Windows directory"
    - "HashRules\\0\\SaferFlags: 0 (Standard hash rule enforcement)"
