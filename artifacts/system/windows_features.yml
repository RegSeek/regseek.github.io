details:
  what: |
    Windows Features configuration encompasses optional component management, server role
    installations, capability packages, feature enablement status, and component-based
    servicing. Controls which Windows features are installed and active, including
    development tools, administrative utilities, networking components, and security
    features that affect system functionality and attack surface.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding system capabilities, enabled attack vectors, and administrative
    tool availability. Shows evidence of features enabled for malicious purposes (such as
    Telnet, IIS, or developer tools), reveals system hardening through feature disabling,
    and indicates specialized functionality that might be abused. Essential for assessing
    system configuration and potential attack methods available to threat actors.

  structure: |
    Component Based Servicing maintains feature installation status, dependency tracking,
    and feature metadata. OptionalFeatures contains user-accessible feature toggles,
    server role configurations, and capability package status. Feature management controls
    enterprise feature policies and administrative restrictions on feature modifications.

  examples:
    - "TelnetClient: 4 (Telnet client enabled - potential security risk)"
    - "IIS-WebServerRole: 2 (Internet Information Services installed)"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux: 2 (WSL feature enabled)"
    - "HypervisorPlatform: 2 (Windows Hypervisor Platform enabled)"
    - "Containers: 2 (Windows containers feature enabled)"
    - "TFTP: 4 (TFTP client enabled)"
    - "SimpleTCP: 4 (Simple TCP/IP services enabled)"
    - "WindowsMediaPlayer: 3 (Windows Media Player disabled)"
