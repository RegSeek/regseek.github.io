details:
  what: |
    Windows location services encompass GPS positioning, Wi-Fi location tracking, cellular
    triangulation, geofencing capabilities, location history storage, and privacy controls
    for location-aware applications. Manages system-wide location permissions, app-specific
    location access, location data retention policies, and geolocation service configuration
    for enhanced user experience and privacy protection.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating location-based evidence, tracking device movement patterns,
    establishing suspect presence at specific locations, and analyzing location-aware malware.
    Shows geolocation access by applications, reveals location tracking that could establish
    alibis or criminal activity, and provides evidence of device presence during incident
    timeframes. Essential for timeline reconstruction and geographic correlation analysis.

  structure: |
    Location consent store contains application permissions for location access organized
    by package family names. Device access controls global location services enablement,
    sensor overrides manage GPS and positioning hardware, and privacy settings control
    location data collection, retention, and sharing policies across applications and services.

  examples:
    - "ConsentStore\\location\\Value: Allow (Global location services enabled)"
    - "Microsoft.Maps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\Value: Allow (Maps app location access)"
    - "Microsoft.BingWeather_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\Value: Deny (Weather app location denied)"
    - "Global\\{BFA794E4-F964-4FDB-90F6-51056BFE4B44}\\Value: Allow (System location access)"
    - "LocationHistory: 1 (Location history tracking enabled)"
    - "SensorPermissionState: 1 (Location sensors enabled)"
    - "DefaultLocation: Redmond, WA (Default/cached location)"
    - "GeoFencing: 1 (Geofencing capabilities enabled)"
