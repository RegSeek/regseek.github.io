details:
  what: |
    AppLocker provides advanced application control policies that replace Software Restriction Policies
    in modern Windows environments. Creates sophisticated whitelisting rules based on publisher signatures,
    file paths, file hashes, and application packages. Controls execution of executables, scripts,
    Windows Installer files, DLLs, and packaged applications with granular policy enforcement.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying security policy bypass attempts, unauthorized application execution,
    and sophisticated attack techniques that circumvent application controls. Shows evidence of
    policy modifications that enable malware execution, reveals authorized application lists that
    may indicate system purpose, and provides insight into administrative security posture.
    Essential for detecting advanced persistent threats that modify security policies for persistence.

  structure: |
    SrpV2 registry contains rule collections organized by file type (Exe, Msi, Script, Dll, Appx)
    with XML policy data defining allow/deny rules. Each rule collection includes enforcement mode,
    rule conditions (publisher, path, hash), and exception handling. Policy data stored as
    REG_SZ XML format with digital signatures for integrity verification.

  examples:
    - "Exe\\Policy: <FilePathRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Windows System Files\" UserOrGroupSid=\"S-1-1-0\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "Script\\Policy: <FilePublisherRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Microsoft Signed Scripts\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "Dll\\Policy: <FileHashRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Approved DLL\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "EnforcementMode: Enabled (Block unapproved applications)"
    - "RuleCollection Type=\"Exe\" EnforcementMode=\"AuditOnly\""
    - "Exception: <Conditions><FilePathCondition Path=\"%TEMP%\\*\" /></Conditions>"
