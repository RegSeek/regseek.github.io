details:
  what: |
    Windows power management encompasses power schemes, sleep/hibernate timers, wake event
    configuration, fast startup settings, power button behavior, and energy-saving policies.
    Controls system sleep behavior, automatic wake events, power state transitions, and
    power management policies that affect system availability and forensic artifact preservation.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding system availability during incident timeframes, detecting
    anti-forensic techniques that use sleep/hibernate to hide activity, and analyzing power
    events that affect timeline reconstruction. Power settings reveal attempts to prevent
    system sleep during malicious activities, or conversely, using power management to
    evade detection by forcing system hibernation after unauthorized access.

  structure: |
    Power configuration includes power scheme GUIDs, sleep timeout values, hibernation
    enablement, fast startup settings, wake timer permissions, and power button actions.
    Advanced settings control display timeout, hard disk sleep, processor power management,
    and system wake events that can interrupt sleep states for various system activities.

  examples:
    - "ActivePowerScheme: {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} (Balanced power plan)"
    - "HibernateEnabled: 1 (Hibernation feature enabled)"
    - "HibernateSize: 16777216 (Hibernation file size in bytes)"
    - "FastStartup: 1 (Fast startup enabled)"
    - "ACSettingIndex: 1800 (30 minutes until sleep on AC power)"
    - "DCSettingIndex: 900 (15 minutes until sleep on battery)"
    - "AllowWakeTimers: 1 (Wake timers permitted)"
    - "PowerButtonAction: 1 (Power button triggers sleep)"
