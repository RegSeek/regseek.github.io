details:
  what: |
    Windows computer identification information encompasses hostname configuration, NetBIOS name
    settings, domain membership status, workgroup assignments, DNS hostname configuration, and
    network identification parameters essential for network communication, authentication, and
    resource access. Manages both current and pending computer name changes with proper
    reboot handling for seamless network identity management.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for system identification in network environments, correlating with Active Directory
    logs, network traffic analysis, and establishing system role in enterprise infrastructure.
    Computer naming patterns may reveal organizational structure, system purpose, geographic
    location, or administrative conventions. Critical for linking registry artifacts to specific
    systems in multi-computer investigations and network forensic analysis.

  structure: |
    ComputerName registry key contains current and active computer names, domain membership
    information, and pending name changes. Tcpip Parameters include DNS hostname, domain
    suffix, and network identification settings. Winlogon contains domain authentication
    and default domain information stored as REG_SZ values with Unicode string formatting.

  examples:
    - "ComputerName: DESKTOP-ABC123 (Default Windows 10 naming pattern)"
    - "ActiveComputerName: WORKSTATION01 (Currently active system name)"
    - "Domain: CORPORATE (Domain membership)"
    - "Hostname: ws01.corporate.local (Fully qualified domain name)"
    - "DnsNameServer: 192.168.1.10,192.168.1.11 (DNS server configuration)"
    - "DefaultDomainName: CORPORATE.LOCAL (Default authentication domain)"
    - "NV Domain: WORKGROUP (NetBIOS workgroup for non-domain systems)"
