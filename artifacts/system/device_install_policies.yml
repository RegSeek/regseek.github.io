  what: |
    Device Installation Policies provide enterprise-level control over hardware device installation,
    removable storage access, and peripheral connectivity through Group Policy enforcement.
    Manages device class restrictions, vendor/product ID filtering, installation privileges,
    removable media access controls, and hardware security policies for comprehensive endpoint
    device management and data loss prevention.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration attempts through unauthorized devices, policy
    bypass techniques, and insider threat activities involving removable storage. Shows if
    device restrictions were disabled to enable unauthorized hardware usage, reveals attempts
    to circumvent security policies, and indicates administrative changes that facilitate
    data theft. Essential for understanding device access capabilities during security incidents.

  structure: |
    Device installation restrictions include AllowDeviceClasses (permitted device types),
    DenyDeviceClasses (blocked device categories), AllowDeviceIDs (specific device permissions),
    DenyDeviceIDs (blocked device identifiers), and RemovableStorageDevices policies controlling
    USB drives, optical media, and external storage access with granular read/write permissions.

  examples:
    - "DenyDeviceClasses\\\\{f2f1b1b1-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1}: Block USB Mass Storage"
    - "AllowDeviceIDs\\\\USB\\\\VID_0951&PID_1666: Allow specific Kingston USB drive"
    - "DenyDeviceIDs\\\\USB\\\\VID_*&PID_*: Block all USB devices"
    - "RemovableStorageDevices\\\\{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}\\\\Deny_Write: 1 (Read-only USB)"
    - "PolicyChangedTime: 2024-01-15 10:30:00 (Policy modification timestamp)"
    - "DeviceInstallPolicy: 0 (Allow installation of any device)"
    - "DeviceInstallPolicy: 1 (Prevent installation of devices not described by other policies)"
