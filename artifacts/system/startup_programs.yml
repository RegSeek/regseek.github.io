details:
  what: |
    Windows startup sequence configuration encompasses boot execution programs, service group
    load order, session manager settings, subsystem initialization, and early program loading
    that occurs during system startup before user logon. Controls critical system component
    initialization, driver loading sequences, and system service dependencies for proper
    system startup and operation in multi-user and enterprise environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying system-level persistence mechanisms that load before security
    software and user-level defenses. Shows boot-time malware installation, startup sequence
    modifications indicating system compromise, and early-loading persistence techniques used
    by advanced threats. Essential for detecting rootkits, boot sector malware, and sophisticated
    persistence mechanisms that establish control during system initialization phases.

  structure: |
    Session Manager contains BootExecute (programs run during boot), SubSystems (core system
    components), ExcludeFromKnownDlls (DLL exclusions), and CriticalDeviceTimeout (hardware
    initialization timeouts). ServiceGroupOrder defines service loading sequence priorities
    for proper dependency management and system stability during startup operations.

  examples:
    - "BootExecute: autocheck autochk *, C:\\\\malware\\\\startup.exe (Malicious boot program)"
    - "ServiceGroupOrder: System Bus Extender, Base, Network Provider (Loading sequence)"
    - "SubSystems: Windows, Posix (Core subsystem definitions)"
    - "ExcludeFromKnownDlls: malicious.dll (DLL exclusion for hijacking)"
    - "CriticalDeviceTimeout: 10 (10-second hardware initialization timeout)"
    - "KnownDLLs: kernel32, ntdll, user32 (Protected system DLLs)"
    - "Execute: wininit (Windows initialization program)"
