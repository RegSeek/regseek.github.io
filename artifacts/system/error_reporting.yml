details:
  what: |
    Windows Error Reporting (WER) service collects and manages crash data, system errors,
    application failures, and debugging information for analysis and troubleshooting. Configuration
    includes crash dump settings, report destinations, disabled applications, automatic restart
    behavior, and debugging options. Manages integration with Microsoft crash analysis services
    and local crash dump storage for comprehensive failure analysis and system stability monitoring.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for forensic investigations as attackers often disable error reporting to hide
    evidence of crashes caused by malicious software exploitation attempts. Shows if crash
    dumps were disabled to prevent memory analysis, reveals crash dump locations containing
    potential forensic evidence, and indicates system stability issues that may result from
    malware activity. Essential for identifying exploitation attempts and recovering crash artifacts.

  structure: |
    WER configuration includes Disabled (global enable/disable), LocalDumps registry containing
    application-specific dump settings, CrashDumpEnabled controlling kernel dump creation,
    and DumpFolder specifying crash dump storage locations. Policy settings override user
    configurations with enterprise-level crash reporting controls and privacy settings.

  examples:
    - "Disabled: 1 (Windows Error Reporting completely disabled)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 1 (Small memory dump - 256KB)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 2 (Kernel memory dump)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 7 (Automatic memory dump)"
    - "DumpFolder: %SystemRoot%\\\\Minidump (Default crash dump location)"
    - "LocalDumps\\\\malware.exe\\\\DumpFolder: C:\\\\CrashDumps (Application-specific dumps)"
    - "AutoReboot: 0 (Don't automatically restart after crash)"
    - "LogEvent: 1 (Log crash events in System Event Log)"
