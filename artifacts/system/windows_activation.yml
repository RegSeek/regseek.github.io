details:
  what: |
    Windows activation and licensing infrastructure encompasses activation status verification,
    product key management, Key Management Service (KMS) configuration, digital entitlement
    validation, and Software Protection Platform settings. Controls license enforcement,
    activation methods, grace periods, and compliance with Microsoft licensing terms
    for genuine Windows installation validation.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for system identification, compliance verification, and detecting unauthorized
    or pirated Windows installations that may indicate security risks. Shows activation
    bypass attempts, KMS server redirection for unauthorized activation, and license
    tampering that could correlate with other security violations. Helps establish
    system legitimacy and organizational compliance during investigations.

  structure: |
    Software Protection Platform contains activation tokens, license status, KMS client
    configuration, and digital rights management data. OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience) settings
    control initial setup behavior and activation flow. WPA (Windows Product Activation)
    maintains activation state and hardware fingerprinting for license enforcement.
