details:
  what: |
    OneDrive cloud storage integration configuration includes sync folder locations, account details,
    synchronization preferences, bandwidth throttling settings, file collaboration configurations,
    and cloud storage management policies. Controls automatic file synchronization, selective sync
    settings, version history, sharing permissions, and integration with Windows Explorer for
    seamless cloud storage access and file management across multiple devices.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating cloud-based data exfiltration, unauthorized file sharing, and
    corporate data leakage through cloud storage services. Shows evidence of files uploaded
    to cloud storage, account configurations that may indicate unauthorized access, sync
    patterns that could reveal data theft timelines, and sharing activities that might
    expose sensitive information. Essential for understanding cloud storage usage in insider
    threat and data breach investigations.

  structure: |
    OneDrive configuration includes UserFolder (local sync directory), Accounts subkey with
    cloud account details, Business/Personal account separation, sync status information,
    and SyncRootManager entries for cloud storage integration. Settings control file
    synchronization behavior, bandwidth usage, sharing permissions, and cloud service
    authentication with various registry data types.

  examples:
    - "UserFolder: C:\\Users\\user\\OneDrive (Default OneDrive sync location)"
    - "Accounts\\Personal\\UserEmail: user@outlook.com (Personal Microsoft account)"
    - "Accounts\\Business1\\UserEmail: user@company.com (Corporate OneDrive account)"
    - "EnableAllOcsiClients: 1 (Office integration enabled)"
    - "DisablePersonalSync: 1 (Personal OneDrive sync disabled by policy)"
    - "PreventNetworkTrafficPreUserSignIn: 0 (Allow network traffic before signin)"
    - "SyncRootManager\\OneDrive: Cloud storage root configuration"
