details:
  what: |
    iCloud for Windows enables synchronization between Windows computers and Apple's
    iCloud services including iCloud Drive, Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and
    Bookmarks. Registry stores Apple ID authentication, sync preferences, storage
    locations, and integration settings for seamless data sharing between Windows
    and Apple ecosystem devices including iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating data synchronization between Windows systems and Apple
    devices, cross-platform data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to Apple
    ecosystem data. Shows evidence of iCloud usage, Apple ID associations, synced
    content types, and potential data leakage between corporate Windows systems and
    personal Apple devices through iCloud synchronization.

  structure: |
    iCloud configuration includes Apple ID credentials, sync service enablement
    (Drive, Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendar), storage locations, and device
    associations. Integration settings control Windows Explorer and Outlook
    synchronization with iCloud services for comprehensive cross-platform data management.

  examples:
    - "AppleID: user@icloud.com (Associated Apple ID)"
    - "iCloudDrive: 1 (iCloud Drive sync enabled)"
    - "Photos: 1 (iCloud Photos sync enabled)"
    - "Mail: 0 (iCloud Mail sync disabled)"
    - "Contacts: 1 (Contact synchronization enabled)"
    - "Calendar: 1 (Calendar sync with Outlook enabled)"
    - "BookmarkSync: 1 (Safari bookmark synchronization)"
