details:
  what: |
    Google Drive Desktop Client stores synchronization configuration including sync folder
    locations, account authentication data, selective sync preferences, bandwidth settings,
    and file stream configurations. Registry tracks installation paths, user accounts,
    Google Workspace integration, backup settings, and Drive File Stream behavior for
    comprehensive cloud storage management and file synchronization across devices.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration through Google Drive, unauthorized file
    sharing to personal accounts, and intellectual property theft. Shows evidence of
    Google Drive usage patterns, synced folder locations, account associations, and
    potential data leakage vectors. Can reveal deliberate or accidental exposure of
    sensitive corporate data through personal Google accounts and unauthorized synchronization.

  structure: |
    Google Drive configuration includes account identifiers, sync root paths, selective
    sync folder lists, bandwidth throttling settings, and Drive File Stream mounting
    options. Installation data provides version information, update preferences, and
    integration settings for comprehensive Google Drive behavior analysis.

  examples:
    - "SyncRootPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Google Drive"
    - "Account: user@company.com (Google Workspace account)"
    - "Account: personal@gmail.com (Personal Google account)"
    - "DriveFS MountPoint: G:\\ (Drive File Stream mount)"
    - "SelectiveSync: {folder1, folder2} (Only specific folders synchronized)"
    - "BandwidthRx: 1024 (Download bandwidth limit in KB/s)"
