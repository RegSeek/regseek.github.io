details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive information about mapped network drives, shared folder connections,
    UNC path access history, and persistent drive mappings. Maintains both active drive mappings
    and historical connection data including server names, share paths, authentication credentials,
    and connection persistence settings. Manages network resource access, automatic reconnection
    preferences, and Most Recently Used (MRU) lists for network location convenience.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating lateral movement, data exfiltration routes, unauthorized network
    access, and corporate espionage through network shares. Shows evidence of file server access,
    shared resource usage patterns, and potential data staging locations on network drives.
    Essential for analyzing advanced persistent threats that leverage legitimate network infrastructure
    for stealth operations and detecting insider threats accessing sensitive network resources.

  structure: |
    Network registry key contains drive letters as subkeys with RemotePath (UNC path), ProviderName
    (network provider), UserName (authentication context), and ConnectionType (persistent/temporary).
    Map Network Drive MRU stores recently accessed UNC paths in chronological order with connection
    frequency and access patterns for user convenience and investigation correlation.

  examples:
    - "Z:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\fileserver.domain.com\\\\shared (Corporate file server)"
    - "Y:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\192.168.1.100\\\\admin$ (Administrative share access)"
    - "X:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\suspicious-server\\\\confidential (Potential unauthorized access)"
    - "ProviderName: Microsoft Windows Network (Standard SMB/CIFS provider)"
    - "UserName: DOMAIN\\\\username (Authentication context for connection)"
    - "ConnectionType: 1 (Persistent connection - reconnects on logon)"
    - "MRU: \\\\\\\\server\\\\finance (Recently accessed financial share)"
