details:
  what: |
    Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) manages file transfers in the
    background using spare network bandwidth, commonly used by Windows Update,
    Microsoft applications, and third-party software. Registry contains service
    configuration, transfer job metadata, bandwidth throttling settings, and
    job state information for both system and user-initiated transfers.

  forensic_value: |
    BITS is increasingly used by malware for stealthy file downloads, data exfiltration,
    and command and control communication. Shows evidence of background file transfers,
    download sources, upload destinations, and potential covert communication channels.
    Can reveal malicious file distribution, data theft operations, or unauthorized
    software installation through background transfer mechanisms.

  structure: |
    Service configuration includes startup type, dependencies, parameters, and
    bandwidth management settings. StateIndex contains job identifiers and transfer
    metadata. Jobs subkey tracks active and completed transfers with source URLs,
    destination paths, transfer states, and authentication information.

  examples:
    - "BITS\\Start: 3 (Manual startup)"
    - "BITS\\Type: 20 (Win32 service, share process)"
    - "BITS\\ObjectName: LocalSystem"
    - "MaxBandwidthPerJob: 2000000 (bytes per second)"
    - "EnableBitsMaxBandwidth: 1"
    - "Job State: Transfer in progress"
    - "StateIndex\\{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}: Job identifier"
    - "Source URL: http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe"
    - "Destination: C:\\temp\\downloaded_malware.exe"
