details:
  what: |
    Windows Bluetooth subsystem maintains comprehensive device pairing history, connection logs,
    device capabilities, authentication keys, and service discovery records. Tracks all Bluetooth
    devices that have been paired, attempted connections, device profiles supported, and wireless
    communication patterns for complete Bluetooth forensic analysis and device correlation.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating wireless data exfiltration, unauthorized device connections, covert
    communication channels, and device tracking. Shows evidence of Bluetooth keyboards, mice, phones,
    headsets, and potential data transfer devices. Essential for insider threat investigations,
    unauthorized device usage, and establishing device presence during incident timeframes.

  structure: |
    Device entries organized by Bluetooth MAC addresses containing device names, pairing timestamps,
    authentication keys, supported services, device types, and connection history. Each device
    maintains profile information, capability flags, and last seen timestamps for comprehensive
    tracking and forensic correlation with other system artifacts.

  examples:
    - "Device: 00:11:22:33:44:55 (Samsung Galaxy S21 - Mobile phone)"
    - "DeviceName: AirPods Pro (Apple wireless earbuds)"
    - "LastConnected: 2024-01-20 15:30:25 UTC (Recent connection timestamp)"
    - "PairingDate: 2024-01-15 09:00:00 UTC (Initial pairing time)"
    - "DeviceType: 0x040418 (Audio/Video device - headphones)"
    - "Services: A2DP, AVRCP, HFP (Audio streaming and control)"
    - "LinkKey: [Binary authentication key data]"
    - "TrustedDevice: 1 (Device marked as trusted)"
