details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive network interface configuration data including IP addresses, 
    subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, DHCP settings, and adapter-specific parameters.
    Each network interface has its own GUID-identified subkey containing current and historical
    network configuration. Includes both static and dynamic (DHCP) configuration data with
    timestamps and lease information.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals network configuration history, static IP assignments, DNS server changes,
    and can show evidence of network pivoting, tunneling, or lateral movement preparation.
    Critical for understanding network connectivity, identifying rogue configurations,
    and correlating network-based attacks with system configuration. Can indicate 
    VPN usage, proxy configurations, and network infrastructure reconnaissance.

  structure: |
    Interface GUIDs as subkeys containing REG_SZ and REG_MULTI_SZ values for network parameters.
    Key values include IPAddress, SubnetMask, DefaultGateway, NameServer, DHCPIPAddress,
    DHCPServer, Domain, EnableDHCP, and lease information. Binary data includes interface
    metrics, adapter settings, and network binding configurations.

  examples:
    - "DHCPIPAddress: 192.168.1.100"
    - "StaticAddress: 10.0.0.50"
    - "SubnetMask: 255.255.255.0"
    - "DefaultGateway: 192.168.1.1"
    - "NameServer: 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1"
    - "DHCPServer: 192.168.1.1"
    - "Domain: company.local"
    - "DHCPLeaseObtainedTime: 1642291200 (Unix timestamp)"
    - "DHCPLeaseTerminatesTime: 1642377600 (Unix timestamp)"
    - "EnableDHCP: 1 (DHCP enabled)"
    - "MTU: 1500"
    - "Interface Metric: 20"
