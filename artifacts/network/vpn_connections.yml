details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive VPN connection profiles, dial-up settings, remote
    access service configurations, and connection history. Includes server addresses,
    authentication methods, encryption protocols, connection parameters for various
    VPN protocols (PPTP, L2TP/IPSec, SSTP, IKEv2), and Point-to-Point Protocol
    configuration for both corporate and personal VPN usage.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows remote network access attempts, VPN usage for potential data exfiltration,
    unauthorized remote access to corporate networks, and can reveal connections to
    suspicious networks, command and control infrastructure, or anonymization services.
    Critical for identifying covert communication channels, unauthorized network access,
    and potential insider threat activities involving external network connections.

  structure: |
    Connection profiles with server addresses, authentication settings, VPN protocols,
    encryption configurations, auto-connect preferences, and credential storage options.
    Phonebook entries contain detailed connection parameters, server endpoints,
    authentication types, and protocol-specific settings stored in binary format.

  examples:
    - "Connection: Corporate VPN"
    - "Server: vpn.company.com"
    - "Protocol: L2TP/IPSec"
    - "Authentication: MS-CHAPv2"
    - "PreSharedKey: [encrypted]"
    - "Tunnel: 192.168.100.1"
    - "Suspicious: Connection: TorVPN-Exit"
    - "Anonymization: Server: vpn.privacy-service.onion"
    - "AutoConnect: 1 (automatic connection)"
    - "SaveCredentials: 1 (credentials stored)"
