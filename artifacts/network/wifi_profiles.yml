details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive WiFi network profile information including SSID names, security
    configurations, connection properties, network categories, and encrypted credentials for
    automatic reconnection. Network signatures track connection history, first/last connection
    times, and network identification data. Maintains both managed (domain) and unmanaged
    (personal) network profiles with detailed connection metadata and location tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for establishing user location patterns, travel history, and potential access points
    visited by suspects. WiFi profiles reveal geographic movement, lifestyle patterns, and
    association with specific locations or organizations. Can indicate compromise through rogue
    access points, unauthorized network access, or reveal investigative leads about suspect
    activities and whereabouts during relevant time periods.

  structure: |
    Network profiles stored with GUIDs as registry keys containing ProfileName (SSID), Description
    (network details), Managed status (domain vs. personal), Category (public/private/domain),
    DateCreated and DateLastConnected as FILETIME values. Signatures maintain network identification
    data and connection correlation information for comprehensive network tracking.

  examples:
    - "ProfileName: CoffeeShop_WiFi (Public WiFi access point)"
    - "ProfileName: HOME-NETWORK-5G (Personal residence network)"
    - "Description: Starbucks Guest Network (Business establishment WiFi)"
    - "Category: 0 (Public network), 1 (Private network), 2 (Domain network)"
    - "DateCreated: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: 2024-01-15 14:30:25)"
    - "DateLastConnected: 0x01DA2F1A2B8C0000 (Recent connection timestamp)"
    - "FirstNetwork: Corporate_Guest (First connected network profile)"
    - "Managed: 1 (Enterprise-managed network profile)"
