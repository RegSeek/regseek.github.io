details:
  what: |
    Windows stores comprehensive firewall configuration including enabled/disabled status,
    firewall rules, port exceptions, application exceptions, network profile settings
    for Domain, Private, and Public networks, and Windows Defender Firewall policies.
    Controls inbound and outbound traffic filtering, application permissions, and
    network security enforcement across different network location types.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows security posture changes, unauthorized firewall rule modifications, malware
    attempts to create network exceptions, and evidence of network policy tampering.
    Critical for understanding network security state, identifying firewall bypass
    attempts, and revealing unauthorized network access permissions that could
    facilitate data exfiltration, lateral movement, or command and control communication.

  structure: |
    Profile-based configuration with subkeys for DomainProfile, StandardProfile
    (Private), and PublicProfile containing EnableFirewall, DefaultInboundAction,
    DefaultOutboundAction, and detailed rule definitions. Binary data includes
    rule specifications, port ranges, application paths, and protocol configurations.

  examples:
    - "DomainProfile\\EnableFirewall: 1 (firewall enabled)"
    - "StandardProfile\\DefaultInboundAction: 1 (block inbound)"
    - "PublicProfile\\DefaultOutboundAction: 0 (allow outbound)"
    - "FirewallRules\\Rule: v2.10|Action=Allow|Active=TRUE|Dir=In|Protocol=6|LPort=80|App=C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\app.exe|"
    - "Exception: Allow TCP 3389 for Remote Desktop"
    - "Malicious: Allow TCP 4444 for C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "GloballyOpenPorts: 445:TCP:*:Enabled:File and Printer Sharing"
    - "AuthorizedApplications: C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe:*:Enabled:Generic Host Process"
