details:
  what: |
    DNS client configuration encompasses comprehensive name resolution settings including cache
    behavior, DNS server preferences, DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) configuration, cache size limits,
    negative caching policies, and DNS security settings. Controls system-wide name resolution
    behavior, cache management policies, and modern DNS security features including encrypted
    DNS protocols and DNS filtering for enhanced privacy and security.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating DNS hijacking attacks, malicious DNS server usage, DNS tunneling
    attempts, and command and control communication through DNS protocols. DNS configuration
    changes may indicate network-based attacks, DNS cache poisoning attempts, or DNS exfiltration
    techniques. Essential for analyzing advanced persistent threats that manipulate DNS infrastructure
    for stealth communication and detecting DNS-based data exfiltration methods.

  structure: |
    DNS configuration includes MaxCacheTtl (maximum cache time), NegativeCacheTime (failed lookup
    caching), CacheHashTableSize (cache table dimensions), EnableAutoDoh (automatic DNS-over-HTTPS),
    DohPolicy (DoH enforcement level), and PrimaryDnsServer (preferred DNS server). Policy settings
    control enterprise DNS behavior, security restrictions, and DNS filtering implementations.

  examples:
    - "MaxCacheTtl: 604800 (7 days maximum cache retention)"
    - "NegativeCacheTime: 300 (5 minutes for failed DNS lookups)"
    - "CacheHashTableSize: 211 (DNS cache hash table size)"
    - "EnableAutoDoh: 2 (Automatic secure DNS resolution enabled)"
    - "DohPolicy: 3 (DNS-over-HTTPS required for all queries)"
    - "PrimaryDnsServer: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS - potential policy violation)"
    - "PrimaryDnsServer: 192.168.1.100 (Internal DNS server)"
    - "DnsPolicy\\\\malicious-domain.com: Block (DNS filtering policy)"
