details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains a comprehensive registry-based database of all installed programs including 
    application names, versions, publishers, install dates, uninstall strings, installation paths, 
    size information, and Windows Installer (MSI) package data. Includes both system-wide and 
    per-user installations with detailed metadata.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides complete software inventory for baseline comparison, identifies malicious or unauthorized 
    software installations, shows installation timeline for correlation with security incidents, 
    reveals software versions for vulnerability assessment, and indicates potential attack tools 
    or suspicious applications.

  structure: |
    Each installed program has a subkey (usually GUID or product name) containing REG_SZ values 
    for DisplayName, DisplayVersion, Publisher, InstallDate (YYYYMMDD), UninstallString, InstallLocation, 
    EstimatedSize, and additional metadata. MSI installations include additional transform and 
    feature information.

  examples:
    - "DisplayName: Adobe Acrobat Reader DC"
    - "DisplayVersion: 2023.008.20470"
    - "Publisher: Adobe Inc."
    - "InstallDate: 20240115"
    - "InstallLocation: C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Acrobat DC"
    - "EstimatedSize: 2097152 (KB)"
    - "UninstallString: C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\Uninstall.exe"
    - "URLInfoAbout: https://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat.html"
    - "Suspicious: DisplayName: System Update Manager"
    - "Malware indicators: Publisher: Unknown, InstallDate: Recent"

limitations:
  - "Software installation records do NOT prove applications were executed or used"
  - "Installation dates don't indicate actual software usage or activity periods"
  - "Uninstall information doesn't prove software was completely removed"
  - "Software presence may be from legitimate business or personal use"
  - "Version information doesn't indicate if vulnerabilities were exploited"
  - "Publisher data can be spoofed or modified by malicious software"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:

    - "File system artifacts showing application usage and data creation"
    - "Registry changes showing application configuration during usage"
    - "Event logs showing application startup and operation events"
    - "Network logs showing application communication if network-enabled"

    - "AmCache or ShimCache entries showing application execution"
    - "UserAssist entries showing user interaction with installed applications"
    - "Recent documents created by installed applications"
    - "File modifications in application directories during usage periods"
