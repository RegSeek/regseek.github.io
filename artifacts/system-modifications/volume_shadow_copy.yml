details:
  what: |
    Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) creates point-in-time copies of files and volumes 
    for backup and restore operations. Configuration controls VSS behavior, restore point 
    creation policies, storage allocation limits, and file exclusions.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for forensic investigations as VSS can be disabled by attackers to prevent 
    data recovery. Shadow copies contain historical file versions that may preserve evidence 
    of deleted or modified files, providing crucial data recovery opportunities.

  structure: |
    VSS service configuration includes startup type and operational parameters. SystemRestore 
    contains policies for restore point creation, disk usage limits (DiskPercent), retention 
    intervals (RPLifeInterval), and monitoring settings.

  examples:
    - "VSS\\Start: 3 (Manual startup - VSS available on demand)"
    - "VSS\\Start: 4 (Disabled - VSS completely unavailable)"
    - "SystemRestore\\DisableSR: 1 (System Restore disabled)"
    - "DiskPercent: 15 (15% maximum disk space allocation)"
    - "RPLifeInterval: 7776000 (90 days restore point retention)"
    - "FilesNotToBackup: *.tmp, pagefile.sys, hiberfil.sys"
    - "CreateRestorePoint: 0 (Automatic restore point creation disabled)"
    - "WindowsBackup\\LastSuccessfulBackupTime: [FILETIME]"

limitations:
  - "VSS configuration does NOT prove shadow copies were actually created"
  - "Service enabled status doesn't indicate successful backup operations"
  - "Restore point policies don't prove points were generated"
  - "Storage allocation doesn't guarantee shadow copy availability"
  - "Disabled VSS may be legitimate system configuration, not attack evidence"
  - "Configuration timestamps show registry changes, not actual VSS activity"
  - "File exclusions don't indicate whether backups were performed"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_backup_activity_proof:
    - "VSS event logs showing actual shadow copy creation and deletion"
