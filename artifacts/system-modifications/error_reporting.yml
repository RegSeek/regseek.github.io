details:
  what: |
    Windows Error Reporting (WER) service collects and manages crash data, system errors, application 
    failures, and debugging information for analysis and troubleshooting. Configuration includes 
    crash dump settings, report destinations, disabled applications, automatic restart behavior, 
    and debugging options.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for forensic investigations as attackers often disable error reporting to hide evidence 
    of crashes caused by malicious software exploitation attempts. Shows if crash dumps were disabled 
    to prevent memory analysis and reveals crash dump locations containing potential forensic evidence.

  structure: |
    WER configuration includes Disabled (global enable/disable), LocalDumps registry containing 
    application-specific dump settings, CrashDumpEnabled controlling kernel dump creation, and 
    DumpFolder specifying crash dump storage locations. Policy settings override user configurations.

  examples:
    - "Disabled: 1 (Windows Error Reporting completely disabled)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 1 (Small memory dump - 256KB)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 2 (Kernel memory dump)"
    - "CrashDumpEnabled: 7 (Automatic memory dump)"
    - "DumpFolder: %SystemRoot%\\\\Minidump (Default crash dump location)"
    - "LocalDumps\\\\malware.exe\\\\DumpFolder: C:\\\\CrashDumps (Application-specific dumps)"
    - "AutoReboot: 0 (Don't automatically restart after crash)"
    - "LogEvent: 1 (Log crash events in System Event Log)"

limitations:
  - "Error reporting configuration does NOT prove system crashes or exploitation occurred"
  - "Disabled error reporting doesn't indicate malicious activity caused the changes"
  - "Crash dump settings don't prove crash dumps were actually created"
  - "Configuration changes may be legitimate administrative system optimization"
  - "Memory dump settings don't indicate forensic evidence exists in dump files"
  - "Debugging configuration may be for legitimate development or troubleshooting purposes"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_crash_evidence:
    - "Actual crash dump files created during system or application failures"
    - "Event logs showing crash events and error reporting service activity"
    - "File system artifacts showing crash dump creation and modification times"
    - "Memory analysis of crash dumps revealing exploitation or malicious activity"
    - "Application logs showing errors and failures during suspicious periods"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Registry changes showing error reporting modifications during attack timeframes"
    - "Event logs showing system instability correlating with malicious activity"
    - "File modifications in crash dump directories during investigation periods"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications crashing during exploitation attempts"
