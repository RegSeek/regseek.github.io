details:
  what: |
    Software Restriction Policies (SRP) provide legacy application control mechanisms that 
    preceded AppLocker in Windows environments. Controls software execution based on path rules, 
    hash rules, certificate rules, and network zone rules with configurable security levels. 
    Provides basic application whitelisting capabilities and execution restrictions.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting legacy security policy bypass attempts, identifying software restrictions 
    that may have been circumvented by attackers, and analyzing application control failures that 
    enabled malware execution. Shows evidence of policy modifications designed to allow unauthorized 
    software execution and reveals legitimate software lists.

  structure: |
    CodeIdentifiers configuration includes DefaultLevel (default security restriction level), 
    ExecutableTypes (file extensions subject to restrictions), TransparentEnabled (policy enforcement 
    mode), and rule collections for specific paths, hashes, certificates, and network zones. 
    Security levels range from Disallowed (blocked) to Unrestricted (allowed).

  examples:
    - "DefaultLevel: 0x00040000 (Unrestricted - allow all software execution)"
    - "DefaultLevel: 0x00000000 (Disallowed - block all software by default)"
    - "ExecutableTypes: ADE;ADP;BAS;BAT;CHM;CMD;COM;CPL;CRT;EXE;HLP;HTA;INF;INS;ISP;LNK;MDB;MDE;MSC;MSI;MSP;MST;OCX;PCD;PIF;REG;SCR;SHS;URL;VB;WSC;WSF;WSH"
    - "TransparentEnabled: 1 (Enforce policies for all users)"
    - "PolicyScope: 0 (Apply to all software)"
    - "PathRules\\0\\Description: Unrestricted access for Windows directory"
    - "HashRules\\0\\SaferFlags: 0 (Standard hash rule enforcement)"

limitations:
  - "Software restriction policies do NOT prove policy bypass attempts occurred"
  - "Policy configurations don't indicate actual software execution or blocking events"
  - "Rule modifications may be legitimate administrative security adjustments"
  - "Security level settings don't prove unauthorized applications were executed"
  - "Policy enforcement may be bypassed through legitimate execution methods"
  - "Policy presence doesn't indicate actual effectiveness or compliance"
