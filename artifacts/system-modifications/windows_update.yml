details:
  what: |
    Windows Update service configuration includes automatic update settings, Windows Server 
    Update Services (WSUS) server configuration, update sources, installation schedules, 
    and patch management settings for maintaining system security.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting security policy modifications where attackers disable updates 
    to maintain vulnerable systems. Reveals WSUS server redirection for malicious update 
    delivery and indicates update tampering for persistent access.

  structure: |
    Update configuration includes AUOptions (automatic update behavior), WUServer (WSUS server), 
    UseWUServer (WSUS enablement), ScheduledInstallDay/Time (installation scheduling), and 
    service registration stored as REG_DWORD and REG_SZ values.

  examples:
    - "AUOptions: 1 (Notify before downloading any updates)"
    - "AUOptions: 4 (Automatically download and install updates)"
    - "WUServer: http://wsus.company.com:8530"
    - "WUServer: http://malicious-wsus.evil.com (Suspicious update server)"
    - "UseWUServer: 1 (Use specified WSUS server instead of Microsoft)"
    - "ScheduledInstallDay: 0 (Install updates every day)"
    - "ScheduledInstallTime: 3 (Install updates at 3:00 AM)"
    - "NoAutoUpdate: 1 (Automatic updates completely disabled)"
    - "DisableWindowsUpdateAccess: 1 (Block access to Windows Update)"

limitations:
  - "Update configuration does NOT prove updates were actually installed"
  - "WSUS server settings don't confirm connection or communication occurred"
  - "Disabled updates may be legitimate enterprise policy, not attack evidence"
  - "Scheduled installation times don't prove updates were applied"
  - "Configuration changes don't indicate who made the modifications"
  - "Update server redirection may be legitimate corporate infrastructure"
  - "Service settings show configuration state, not update installation history"
