details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains comprehensive hardware device information including complete device enumeration 
    data, installed device drivers, hardware capabilities, device properties, configuration settings, 
    and system hardware inventory. Tracks all system components including CPUs, storage devices, 
    network adapters, USB devices, and audio equipment.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides essential hardware inventory for system identification, baseline establishment, and 
    investigation correlation. Shows connected external devices that may have been used for data 
    transfer or evidence destruction, reveals specialized hardware that could indicate system purpose, 
    and identifies hardware changes that might indicate tampering.

  structure: |
    Device enumeration organized hierarchically by bus type (PCI, USB, IDE, ACPI, etc.) with unique 
    device instance identifiers. Each device contains DeviceDesc (description), HardwareID (vendor/product), 
    Service (driver), LocationInformation (physical location), and Capabilities (device features).

  examples:
    - "ENUM\\PCI\\VEN_8086&DEV_1234&SUBSYS_56781234&REV_01: Intel Network Adapter"
    - "ENUM\\USB\\VID_0951&PID_1666: Kingston DataTraveler USB Drive"
    - "ENUM\\IDE\\DiskST31000528AS: Seagate 1TB Hard Drive"
    - "ENUM\\ACPI\\GenuineIntel_-_Intel64_Family_6_Model_158: Intel Core i7 CPU"
    - "Class\\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}: Disk Drives Class"
    - "Services\\nvlddmkm: NVIDIA Display Driver Service"
    - "DeviceDesc: High Definition Audio Controller"
    - "HardwareID: PCI\\VEN_10DE&DEV_1B83 (NVIDIA Graphics Card)"

limitations:
  - "Hardware enumeration does NOT prove devices were actively used"
  - "Device presence doesn't indicate data transfer or malicious activity occurred"
  - "Driver installation doesn't prove device functionality or operation"
  - "Hardware configuration may be from legitimate system setup or maintenance"
  - "Device capabilities don't indicate actual usage patterns or activities"
  - "Connection records don't prove unauthorized access or data exfiltration"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "Event logs showing device driver loading and hardware operation events"
    - "File system artifacts showing device-specific software or data access"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications interacting with specific hardware"
    - "Registry changes showing device configuration during usage periods"
    - "Network logs if devices were used for network communication"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "USB device connection logs correlating with hardware enumeration data"
    - "Driver installation logs showing hardware setup during investigation periods"
    - "File modifications showing device-specific software installation or usage"
    - "Registry changes in related hardware configuration areas"
