details:
  what: |
    Device Installation Policies provide enterprise-level control over hardware device installation, 
    removable storage access, and peripheral connectivity through Group Policy enforcement. Manages 
    device class restrictions, vendor/product ID filtering, and removable media access controls 
    for comprehensive endpoint device management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration attempts through unauthorized devices, policy 
    bypass techniques, and insider threat activities involving removable storage. Shows if device 
    restrictions were disabled to enable unauthorized hardware usage and reveals attempts to 
    circumvent security policies.

  structure: |
    Device installation restrictions include AllowDeviceClasses (permitted device types), 
    DenyDeviceClasses (blocked device categories), AllowDeviceIDs (specific device permissions), 
    DenyDeviceIDs (blocked device identifiers), and RemovableStorageDevices policies controlling 
    USB drives and external storage access.

  examples:
    - "DenyDeviceClasses\\\\{f2f1b1b1-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1-b1b1b1b1b1b1}: Block USB Mass Storage"
    - "AllowDeviceIDs\\\\USB\\\\VID_0951&PID_1666: Allow specific Kingston USB drive"
    - "DenyDeviceIDs\\\\USB\\\\VID_*&PID_*: Block all USB devices"
    - "RemovableStorageDevices\\\\{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}\\\\Deny_Write: 1 (Read-only USB)"
    - "PolicyChangedTime: 2024-01-15 10:30:00 (Policy modification timestamp)"
    - "DeviceInstallPolicy: 0 (Allow installation of any device)"
    - "DeviceInstallPolicy: 1 (Prevent installation of devices not described by other policies)"

limitations:
  - "Device installation policies do NOT prove unauthorized device usage occurred"
  - "Restriction configurations don't indicate actual device installation attempts"
  - "Policy modifications may be legitimate administrative security adjustments"
  - "Device access controls don't prove data exfiltration or unauthorized transfer"
  - "USB restrictions may be bypassed through other connection methods"
  - "Policy enforcement depends on active Group Policy application"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_violation_proof:
    - "Event logs showing device installation attempts and policy enforcement results"
    - "USB device connection logs showing actual hardware usage despite restrictions"
    - "File system artifacts showing data transfer to/from restricted devices"
    - "Registry changes showing policy modifications during suspicious periods"
    - "Application logs showing device access attempts and policy violations"
