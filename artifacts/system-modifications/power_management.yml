details:
  what: |
    Windows power management encompasses power schemes, sleep/hibernate timers, wake event 
    configuration, fast startup settings, power button behavior, and energy-saving policies. 
    Controls system sleep behavior, automatic wake events, power state transitions, and 
    power management policies that affect system availability.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding system availability during incident timeframes, detecting 
    anti-forensic techniques that use sleep/hibernate to hide activity, and analyzing power 
    events that affect timeline reconstruction. Power settings reveal attempts to prevent 
    system sleep during malicious activities or using power management to evade detection.

  structure: |
    Power configuration includes power scheme GUIDs, sleep timeout values, hibernation 
    enablement, fast startup settings, wake timer permissions, and power button actions. 
    Advanced settings control display timeout, hard disk sleep, processor power management, 
    and system wake events.

  examples:
    - "ActivePowerScheme: {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} (Balanced power plan)"
    - "HibernateEnabled: 1 (Hibernation feature enabled)"
    - "HibernateSize: 16777216 (Hibernation file size in bytes)"
    - "FastStartup: 1 (Fast startup enabled)"
    - "ACSettingIndex: 1800 (30 minutes until sleep on AC power)"
    - "DCSettingIndex: 900 (15 minutes until sleep on battery)"
    - "AllowWakeTimers: 1 (Wake timers permitted)"
    - "PowerButtonAction: 1 (Power button triggers sleep)"

limitations:
  - "Power management configuration does NOT prove system sleep states actually occurred"
  - "Sleep timer settings don't indicate when system was actually sleeping or awake"
  - "Hibernation settings don't prove hibernation files contain specific evidence"
  - "Wake event configuration doesn't indicate what caused system wake events"
  - "Power scheme modifications may be for legitimate energy management"
  - "Fast startup settings don't prove system boot/shutdown timing manipulation"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_timeline_proof:
    - "Event logs showing actual system sleep/wake events with timestamps"
    - "File system artifacts showing file access patterns during configured sleep periods"
    - "Process execution logs showing application activity during power state transitions"
    - "Network logs showing connectivity during configured sleep/wake cycles"
    - "Registry changes showing power configuration modifications during investigation periods"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Hibernation files containing memory dumps from specific time periods"
    - "Event logs showing wake events triggered by specific applications or network activity"
    - "File modifications correlating with power state changes and wake events"
    - "Registry changes in other system areas during power configuration modifications"
