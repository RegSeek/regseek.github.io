details:
  what: |
    Windows mobile device integration includes Cross-Device Platform (CDP) configuration, device 
    synchronization settings, Your Phone app connections, Bluetooth pairing, notification mirroring, 
    and cross-platform continuity features for smartphone and tablet integration.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows evidence of paired mobile devices, synchronization activities, and cross-platform file access. 
    Useful for investigating mobile attack vectors, BYOD policy violations, and multi-device security 
    incidents. Can reveal data synchronization between corporate systems and personal devices.

  structure: |
    CDP configuration includes device discovery settings, paired device information, and sync preferences. 
    DeviceAccess controls mobile device permissions and notification access. WINEVT channels track 
    device synchronization events and connection history.

  examples:
    - "CDP\\UserActivities\\EnableCdpUserService: 1 (Cross-device platform enabled)"
    - "DeviceAccess\\Global\\{BFA794E4-F964-4FDB-90F6-51056BFE4B44}: Allow (Location access)"

    - "NotificationMirroring: 1 (Mobile notification sync enabled)"
    - "Connectivity\\AllowPhonePC: 1 (Phone-PC linking permitted)"
    - "CrossDeviceClipboard: 1 (Clipboard sharing between devices)"

limitations:
  - "Pairing configuration does NOT prove active data synchronization occurred"
  - "Device permissions don't indicate what data was actually accessed"
  - "Cross-device settings show capability, not actual usage or file transfers"
  - "Notification mirroring enablement doesn't prove sensitive data was shared"
  - "Your Phone app connection doesn't indicate what content was synchronized"
  - "Bluetooth pairing may be for legitimate productivity purposes"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_sync_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing actual synchronized files or photos"
    - "Network traffic logs showing data transfer between devices"
    - "Application logs from Your Phone app showing successful sync operations"
    - "Bluetooth connection logs with data transfer indicators"
    - "Event logs showing successful device authentication and data access"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents created or modified during device connection periods"
    - "Clipboard history showing cross-device copy/paste operations"
    - "Photo/video files with metadata indicating mobile device origin"
    - "Network connections to cloud services during sync periods"
