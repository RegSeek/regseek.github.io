details:
  what: |
    OneDrive cloud storage integration configuration includes sync folder locations,
    account details, synchronization preferences, bandwidth settings, and file
    collaboration configurations. Controls automatic file synchronization and
    integration with Windows Explorer.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating cloud-based data exfiltration and unauthorized file sharing.
    Shows evidence of files uploaded to cloud storage, account configurations,
    sync patterns that could reveal data theft timelines, and sharing activities
    that might expose sensitive information.

  structure: |
    OneDrive configuration includes UserFolder (local sync directory), Accounts subkey
    with cloud account details, Business/Personal account separation, and SyncRootManager
    entries for cloud storage integration. Settings control synchronization behavior
    and sharing permissions.

  examples:
    - "UserFolder: C:\\Users\\user\\OneDrive (Default OneDrive sync location)"
    - "Accounts\\Personal\\UserEmail: user@outlook.com (Personal Microsoft account)"
    - "Accounts\\Business1\\UserEmail: user@company.com (Corporate OneDrive account)"
    - "EnableAllOcsiClients: 1 (Office integration enabled)"
    - "DisablePersonalSync: 1 (Personal OneDrive sync disabled by policy)"
    - "PreventNetworkTrafficPreUserSignIn: 0 (Allow network traffic before signin)"
    - "SyncRootManager\\OneDrive: Cloud storage root configuration"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual files synced or shared"
  - "Account presence doesn't prove active data synchronization occurred"
  - "Sync settings may be overridden by Group Policy or user actions"
  - "Personal/business account separation may not reflect actual usage patterns"
