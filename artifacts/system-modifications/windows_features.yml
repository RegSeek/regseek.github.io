details:
  what: |
    Windows Features configuration controls optional component management, server role 
    installations, and capability packages. Manages which Windows features are installed 
    and active, affecting system functionality and attack surface.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding system capabilities and enabled attack vectors. Shows evidence 
    of features enabled for malicious purposes (Telnet, IIS, developer tools), reveals system 
    hardening through feature disabling, and indicates specialized functionality abuse.

  structure: |
    Component Based Servicing maintains feature installation status and dependency tracking. 
    OptionalFeatures contains user-accessible feature toggles and server role configurations. 
    Feature management controls enterprise policies and administrative restrictions.

  examples:
    - "TelnetClient: 4 (Telnet client enabled - potential security risk)"
    - "IIS-WebServerRole: 2 (Internet Information Services installed)"
    - "Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux: 2 (WSL feature enabled)"
    - "HypervisorPlatform: 2 (Windows Hypervisor Platform enabled)"
    - "Containers: 2 (Windows containers feature enabled)"
    - "TFTP: 4 (TFTP client enabled)"
    - "SimpleTCP: 4 (Simple TCP/IP services enabled)"
    - "WindowsMediaPlayer: 3 (Windows Media Player disabled)"

limitations:
  - "Feature installation status does NOT prove feature was actually used"
  - "Enabled features don't indicate when they were activated or by whom"
  - "Feature configuration shows availability, not actual utilization"
  - "Administrative installation may enable features without user knowledge"
  - "Disabled features may be legitimate security hardening, not evidence tampering"
  - "Feature states don't prove specific activities or attacks occurred"
  - "Installation timestamps show registry changes, not feature usage"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_feature_usage_proof:
    - "Application event logs showing feature utilization"
    - "Service execution logs confirming feature services were started"
    - "Network logs showing traffic through enabled network features"
    - "Process execution logs showing feature-related programs running"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Registry Run keys or services related to enabled features"
    - "File system artifacts showing feature configuration or data"
    - "User activity artifacts related to feature-specific applications"
    - "Security logs showing feature-based authentication or access"
