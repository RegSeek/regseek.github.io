details:
  what: |
    AppLocker provides advanced application control policies that replace Software Restriction Policies 
    in modern Windows environments. Creates sophisticated whitelisting rules based on publisher signatures, 
    file paths, file hashes, and application packages. Controls execution of executables, scripts, 
    Windows Installer files, DLLs, and packaged applications.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying security policy bypass attempts, unauthorized application execution, 
    and sophisticated attack techniques that circumvent application controls. Shows evidence of 
    policy modifications that enable malware execution and reveals authorized application lists.

  structure: |
    SrpV2 registry contains rule collections organized by file type (Exe, Msi, Script, Dll, Appx) 
    with XML policy data defining allow/deny rules. Each rule collection includes enforcement mode, 
    rule conditions (publisher, path, hash), and exception handling stored as REG_SZ XML format.

  examples:
    - "Exe\\Policy: <FilePathRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Windows System Files\" UserOrGroupSid=\"S-1-1-0\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "Script\\Policy: <FilePublisherRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Microsoft Signed Scripts\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "Dll\\Policy: <FileHashRule Id=\"{GUID}\" Name=\"Approved DLL\" Action=\"Allow\">"
    - "EnforcementMode: Enabled (Block unapproved applications)"
    - "RuleCollection Type=\"Exe\" EnforcementMode=\"AuditOnly\""
    - "Exception: <Conditions><FilePathCondition Path=\"%TEMP%\\*\" /></Conditions>"

limitations:
  - "AppLocker policies do NOT prove bypass attempts or security violations occurred"
  - "Rule configurations don't indicate actual application execution or blocking events"
  - "Policy modifications may be legitimate administrative security adjustments"
  - "Enforcement mode settings don't prove unauthorized applications were executed"
  - "Exception rules may be required for legitimate business applications"
  - "Policy presence doesn't indicate actual effectiveness or compliance"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_bypass_proof:
    - "Event logs showing blocked or allowed application execution events"
    - "Process execution logs showing unauthorized applications running despite policies"
    - "Application logs showing successful execution of applications outside policy rules"
    - "File system artifacts showing unauthorized applications executed in restricted environments"
    - "Registry changes showing policy modifications during suspicious activity periods"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Event logs showing AppLocker rule triggering during execution attempts"
    - "Policy change logs showing rule modifications correlating with attack timelines"
    - "Process execution showing applications launched through policy bypass techniques"
    - "File system access showing unauthorized application installation attempts"
