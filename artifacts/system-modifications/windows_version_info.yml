details:
  what: |
    Windows stores version identification information including build numbers, edition details, 
    installation timestamps, product keys, registered owner information, update history, and 
    licensing data for complete system identification.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for establishing system baseline information, determining available Windows 
    features and security capabilities, and identifying Windows editions for vulnerability 
    assessment and investigation correlation.

  structure: |
    Version information stored as REG_SZ strings and REG_DWORD values including ProductName, 
    CurrentBuild, ReleaseId, InstallDate (Unix timestamp), RegisteredOwner, DigitalProductId, 
    and update information for comprehensive system identification.

  examples:
    - "ProductName: Windows 11 Pro"
    - "ProductName: Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC"
    - "CurrentBuild: 22621 (Windows 11 22H2 build number)"
    - "CurrentBuild: 19044 (Windows 10 21H2 build number)"
    - "ReleaseId: 22H2 (Feature update identifier)"
    - "InstallDate: 0x63A1B2C0 (Unix timestamp: 1671450304 = December 19, 2022)"
    - "RegisteredOwner: CORPORATE\\ITDepartment"
    - "RegisteredOrganization: Acme Corporation"
    - "DigitalProductId: [Binary license and product key data]"

limitations:
  - "Version information does NOT prove system activity or usage patterns"
  - "Installation date shows registry creation, not actual system deployment"
  - "Registered owner doesn't prove who actually uses the system"
  - "Edition details don't indicate which features are actively enabled"
  - "Build numbers don't prove specific security patches are installed"
  - "Version data may be modified by system updates or registry editing"
  - "Product information doesn't indicate system configuration or security state"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_system_capability_proof:
    - "Installed programs registry showing actual feature installations"
    - "Windows Features configuration showing enabled capabilities"
    - "Security event logs confirming available security features"
    - "File system artifacts showing Windows component presence"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Update history logs showing patch level and security updates"
    - "Hardware device registry showing compatible features"
    - "Network configuration showing available protocols and services"
    - "Application logs showing feature utilization"
