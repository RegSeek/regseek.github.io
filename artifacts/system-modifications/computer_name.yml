details:
  what: |
    Windows computer identification information encompasses hostname configuration, NetBIOS name 
    settings, domain membership status, workgroup assignments, DNS hostname configuration, and 
    network identification parameters essential for network communication and authentication.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for system identification in network environments, correlating with Active Directory 
    logs, and network traffic analysis. Computer naming patterns may reveal organizational structure, 
    system purpose, geographic location, or administrative conventions. Critical for linking registry 
    artifacts to specific systems in multi-computer investigations.

  structure: |
    ComputerName registry key contains current and active computer names, domain membership 
    information, and pending name changes. Tcpip Parameters include DNS hostname, domain suffix, 
    and network identification settings. Winlogon contains domain authentication information.

  examples:
    - "ComputerName: DESKTOP-ABC123 (Default Windows 10 naming pattern)"
    - "ActiveComputerName: WORKSTATION01 (Currently active system name)"
    - "Domain: CORPORATE (Domain membership)"
    - "Hostname: ws01.corporate.local (Fully qualified domain name)"
    - "DnsNameServer: 192.168.1.10,192.168.1.11 (DNS server configuration)"
    - "DefaultDomainName: CORPORATE.LOCAL (Default authentication domain)"
    - "NV Domain: WORKGROUP (NetBIOS workgroup for non-domain systems)"

limitations:
  - "Computer name configuration does NOT prove network communication occurred"
  - "Domain membership settings don't indicate actual network access or authentication"
  - "Hostname configuration doesn't prove system was actively used on the network"
  - "DNS settings don't indicate actual DNS queries or network traffic"
  - "Network identification may be configured but network interfaces could be disabled"
  - "Domain authentication settings don't prove successful domain logons occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_network_activity_proof:
    - "Network traffic logs showing actual communication using the configured hostname"
    - "Event logs showing domain authentication and network access events"
    - "DNS query logs showing hostname resolution and network activity"
    - "Active Directory logs showing computer account authentication"
    - "File server logs showing network file access from the identified computer"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Network interface configuration showing active network connections"
    - "Event logs showing successful domain logons using computer credentials"
    - "Registry changes showing network configuration during investigation periods"
    - "File system artifacts showing network resource access"
