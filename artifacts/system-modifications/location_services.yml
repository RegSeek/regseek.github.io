details:
  what: |
    Windows location services encompass GPS positioning, Wi-Fi location tracking, cellular triangulation, 
    geofencing capabilities, location history storage, and privacy controls for location-aware applications. 
    Manages system-wide location permissions, app-specific location access, and location data retention 
    policies for enhanced user experience and privacy protection.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating location-based evidence, tracking device movement patterns, establishing 
    suspect presence at specific locations, and analyzing location-aware malware. Shows geolocation 
    access by applications, reveals location tracking that could establish alibis or criminal activity, 
    and provides evidence of device presence during incident timeframes.

  structure: |
    Location consent store contains application permissions for location access organized by package 
    family names. Device access controls global location services enablement, sensor overrides manage 
    GPS and positioning hardware, and privacy settings control location data collection, retention, 
    and sharing policies across applications and services.

  examples:
    - "ConsentStore\\location\\Value: Allow (Global location services enabled)"
    - "Microsoft.Maps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\Value: Allow (Maps app location access)"
    - "Microsoft.BingWeather_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\Value: Deny (Weather app location denied)"
    - "Global\\{BFA794E4-F964-4FDB-90F6-51056BFE4B44}\\Value: Allow (System location access)"
    - "LocationHistory: 1 (Location history tracking enabled)"
    - "SensorPermissionState: 1 (Location sensors enabled)"
    - "DefaultLocation: Redmond, WA (Default/cached location)"
    - "GeoFencing: 1 (Geofencing capabilities enabled)"

limitations:
  - "Location service configuration does NOT prove actual location tracking occurred"
  - "Permission grants don't indicate GPS data was collected or transmitted"
  - "Location settings don't prove device was present at specific geographic locations"
  - "Application location access doesn't indicate successful geolocation operations"
  - "Privacy settings may be configured but location hardware could be disabled"
  - "Location history enablement doesn't prove historical location data exists"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_location_proof:
    - "Actual location data files showing GPS coordinates and timestamps"
    - "Application logs showing successful location queries and responses"
    - "Network logs showing location service communication and data transmission"
    - "File system artifacts showing location-tagged photos or documents"
    - "Event logs showing location service activation and GPS hardware usage"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Wi-Fi network logs showing location-based network connections"
    - "Registry changes showing location configuration during investigation periods"
    - "File modifications in location data directories during permission usage"
    - "Network traffic showing location service communication patterns"
