details:
  what: |
    iTunes for Windows manages Apple device synchronization including iPhone, iPad, and iPod connections, 
    backup locations, media library sync, and device management. Registry stores device identifiers, 
    backup paths, and sync preferences for Apple ecosystem integration.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows evidence of mobile device connections, data synchronization between Windows and Apple devices, 
    and backup locations containing mobile device data. Can reveal access to mobile device data through 
    iTunes backups and synchronization activities.

  structure: |
    iTunes configuration includes device registration data, backup storage paths, sync preferences, 
    media library locations, and Apple ID authentication. Mobile Device Support entries track connected 
    devices and synchronization history.

  examples:
    - "StoreAccountName: user@icloud.com (Associated Apple ID)"
    - "LastBackupPath: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Apple Computer\\MobileSync\\Backup"
    - "DeviceID: 1234567890abcdef (Connected device identifier)"
    - "DeviceName: John's iPhone (User device name)"
    - "BackupDirectory: {device-guid} (Device-specific backup folder)"
    - "SyncLibrary: 1 (Music library synchronization enabled)"
    - "AutoSync: 0 (Automatic sync disabled)"

limitations:
  - "iTunes configuration does NOT prove device synchronization actually occurred"
  - "Backup path settings don't indicate successful backup completion"
  - "Device registration may be from failed connection attempts"
  - "Sync preferences show configuration, not actual data transfer activity"
  - "Apple ID association doesn't prove device ownership or authorized access"
  - "Media library settings don't indicate what content was synchronized"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_sync_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing actual iTunes backup files created"
    - "Application logs showing successful synchronization operations"
    - "Network traffic logs showing data transfer to/from Apple devices"
    - "File modification times on backup directories during device connection"
    - "Event logs showing successful device authentication and access"

    - "USB device connection logs correlating to iTunes sync times"
