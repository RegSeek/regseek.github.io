details:
  what: |
    Windows Telephony API (TAPI) and communication services configuration.
    Controls VoIP integration, telephony service providers, messaging protocols,
    and unified communication platform settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating unauthorized communication channels, VoIP-based data
    exfiltration, and covert communication protocols. Shows telephony applications
    and protocol settings that might indicate command and control communication.

  structure: |
    Configuration includes TAPI service providers, communication device registrations,
    protocol handlers, messaging service configurations, and VoIP integration settings.

  examples:
    - "Telephony\\Providers\\Provider0: unimdm.tsp (Universal modem TSP)"
    - "Communications\\CallHistoryEnabled: 1 (Call history tracking enabled)"
    - "TapiSrv\\Start: 3 (Telephony service manual startup)"
    - "VoIPProtocols\\SIP: Enabled (Session Initiation Protocol support)"
    - "MessagingProtocols\\SMTP: smtp.company.com:587 (Email server configuration)"
    - "CommunicationApps\\Teams: Registered (Microsoft Teams integration)"

limitations:
  - "Shows service setup only, not actual call records or communication content"
  - "Service provider registration doesn't prove telephony services were used"
  - "Protocol configuration doesn't indicate what communications occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "Call detail records (CDR) from telephony systems showing actual communication"
    - "Network traffic analysis confirming VoIP protocol usage"
    - "Application logs from telephony software showing call activity"
  
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Communication app artifacts showing integrated telephony usage"
    - "Network configuration artifacts showing VoIP infrastructure setup"
    - "Device management artifacts showing communication hardware integration"
