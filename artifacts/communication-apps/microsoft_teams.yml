details:
  what: |
    Teams client settings for enterprise communication. Stores user authentication,
    tenant configurations, meeting settings, and Office 365 integration preferences.

  forensic_value: |
    Useful for understanding Teams client configuration and organizational settings that
    may provide context for communication investigations. Shows tenant associations and
    policy settings that could be relevant for determining authorized communication channels.
    Note: Registry data contains configuration only, NOT actual communication content.

  structure: |
    Configuration includes tenant identifiers, user principal names, meeting policies,
    chat settings, file sharing permissions, and device integration preferences.

  examples:
    - "TenantId: company.onmicrosoft.com (Office 365 tenant)"
    - "UserPrincipalName: user@company.com (Teams account identifier)"
    - "AllowExternalAccess: 0 (External Teams communication blocked)"
    - "AllowGuestAccess: 1 (Guest users allowed in meetings)"
    - "RecordingPolicy: Enabled (Meeting recording allowed)"
    - "FileSharing: Restricted (Limited file sharing capabilities)"
