details:
  what: |
    Windows anti-malware quarantine system maintains comprehensive records of detected threats,
    quarantined files, malware signatures, threat classifications, detection timestamps, and
    security incident tracking. Manages isolated malicious files, threat analysis results,
    automatic response actions, and malware family identification for comprehensive endpoint
    protection and forensic analysis capabilities.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for malware incident analysis, threat timeline reconstruction, and understanding
    attack vectors used against the system. Shows evidence of malware detection, quarantine
    actions, threat persistence attempts, and security software effectiveness. Critical for
    identifying attack campaigns, malware families, and establishing infection timelines.
    Provides direct evidence of malicious activity and security response effectiveness.

  structure: |
    Quarantine entries contain threat identifiers, file locations, detection timestamps, threat
    categories, and quarantine actions. ThreatIDDefaultAction maps threat identifiers to
    automatic response behaviors. RemovalTools contains malware removal utility execution
    history and specialized cleaning tool deployment information with binary threat data.
