details:
  what: |
    Registry key last write times provide precise timestamps indicating when USB storage devices 
    were last connected, enumerated, or had their configuration updated by the Windows Plug and Play 
    subsystem. These timestamps correlate with device connection events and driver installations.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for establishing precise USB device connection timelines in data exfiltration investigations. 
    Provides exact timestamps for when specific USB devices were connected, enabling correlation with 
    file access logs, user activity, and security events for timeline reconstruction.

  structure: |
    Registry key timestamps stored as FILETIME structures (64-bit values representing 100-nanosecond 
    intervals since January 1, 1601 UTC). Each USB device subkey's last write time indicates most 
    recent connection or configuration change with vendor ID, product ID, and serial number correlation.

  examples:
    - "Device Key: USBSTOR\\\\Disk&Ven_Kingston&Prod_DataTraveler_3.0&Rev_PMAP"
    - "Last Write Time: 2024-01-15 09:45:23.123 UTC (Precise connection timestamp)"
    - "Serial Number: 50E549C6E258F571&0 (Unique device identifier)"
    - "Device Instance: 001CC0EC336BD480&0 (Hardware instance ID)"
    - "Parent Key: USB\\\\VID_0951&PID_1666 (Vendor/Product identification)"
    - "Connection Event: Registry key modification indicates device enumeration"

limitations:
  - "Last write times do NOT prove files were accessed or transferred from device"
  - "Registry timestamps show device enumeration, not actual usage or data operations"
  - "Connection events may be from antivirus scanning or system maintenance"
  - "Multiple timestamps don't necessarily indicate repeated data theft"
  - "Device enumeration can occur without user interaction or file access"
  - "Registry modification may be from driver updates or configuration changes"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing actual file access during connection times"
    - "Event logs (Event ID 6416) showing volume mounting and file operations"
    - "ShellBags showing user navigation to USB device during connection window"
    - "Recent documents or LNK files with timestamps matching connection periods"
    - "Application logs showing file operations during device connection times"
