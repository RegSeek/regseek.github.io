details:
  what: |
    Windows stores USB device information including vendor/product IDs (VID/PID), device capabilities, 
    hardware characteristics, power requirements, and supported features. Tracks both storage and 
    non-storage USB devices with technical specifications and driver associations for device enumeration.

  forensic_value: |
    Identifies device capabilities beyond basic vendor information. Can reveal specialized hardware, 
    covert devices, modified USB devices, or attack tools designed for data exfiltration. Useful 
    for detecting USB weaponization attempts, device modification, and sophisticated surveillance equipment.

  structure: |
    Device instance subkeys identified by VID (Vendor ID) and PID (Product ID) containing Capabilities, 
    DeviceDesc, HardwareID, CompatibleIDs, and Service values. Binary capability flags indicate supported 
    features and power characteristics. ContainerID links related device interfaces.

  examples:
    - "VID_0951&PID_1666: Kingston DataTraveler USB drive"
    - "DeviceDesc: USB Mass Storage Device"
    - "HardwareID: USBSTOR\\DiskSanDisk_Cruzer_Blade____1.00"
    - "Capabilities: 0x00000084 (Removable | UniqueID)"
    - "Service: USBSTOR (USB storage driver)"
    - "ContainerID: {12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}"
    - "Problem: 0 (Device working properly)"
    - "ClassGUID: {36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000} (USB device class)"
    - "PowerData: Bus-powered device, 500mA maximum"
    - "DeviceClass: Mass Storage"

limitations:
  - "Device capability registration does NOT prove device was actively used for data transfer"
  - "Hardware properties don't indicate what files were accessed or copied"
  - "Device enumeration occurs during connection but doesn't prove malicious activity"
  - "Capability flags may not reflect actual device usage or user actions"
  - "Driver association doesn't indicate successful data operations"
  - "Device presence doesn't prove data exfiltration or unauthorized access"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing actual file access or modification on USB device"
    - "Event logs (Event ID 6416) showing volume mounting and access"
    - "ShellBags showing user navigation to USB drive folders"
    - "Recent documents referencing files from USB device"
    - "Link files (.lnk) pointing to USB device locations"

    - "USB device connection timestamps from last write times"
    - "Drive letter assignments showing device mounting"
    - "Prefetch files showing execution of programs from USB device"
    - "Network logs if USB device contained remote access tools"
