details:
  what: |
    Windows Portable Device Bus Enumerator (WPDBUSENUM) tracks connections of portable devices including 
    smartphones, digital cameras, media players, and tablets that use Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) or 
    Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) rather than appearing as traditional storage devices.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for mobile device forensics and investigations involving smartphones, tablets, and digital 
    cameras. Shows evidence of mobile device connections that could indicate data transfer, photo/video 
    extraction, or mobile device exploitation even when devices don't mount as traditional drives.

  structure: |
    Device entries organized under WPDBUSENUM with unique device identifiers containing DeviceDesc, 
    HardwareID, Service, ContainerID, and connection metadata. Each device maintains enumeration data, 
    capabilities information, and driver binding details.

  examples:
    - "WPDBUSENUM\\\\{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}\\\\0000: iPhone connection"
    - "DeviceDesc: Apple iPhone (Device description)"
    - "HardwareID: WPDBUSENUM\\\\Apple_iPhone (Hardware identification)"
    - "Service: WUDFRd (Windows User-Mode Driver Framework)"
    - "ContainerID: {abcdef12-3456-789a-bcde-f123456789ab} (Device container)"
    - "FriendlyName: John's iPhone (User-assigned device name)"
    - "Manufacturer: Apple Inc. (Device manufacturer)"
    - "DeviceInterfaceGUIDs: Media Transfer Protocol interfaces"

limitations:
  - "Device enumeration does NOT prove files were transferred to or from the device"
  - "Connection records don't indicate what data operations occurred"
  - "MTP/PTP device presence doesn't prove unauthorized data access"
  - "Device capabilities registration may be from legitimate sync or charging"
  - "Portable device connection doesn't indicate successful data extraction"
  - "Driver association may occur without actual file transfer operations"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_access_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing files transferred from portable device"
    - "Application logs showing successful MTP/PTP data operations"
    - "Recent documents or photos with metadata indicating portable device origin"
    - "Event logs showing successful device authentication and data access"
    - "Network logs if device was used for internet access or cloud synchronization"

    - "Registry timestamps correlating device connection to file transfer times"
    - "Photo/video files with EXIF data matching connected camera or phone"
    - "USB connection logs showing physical device attachment"
    - "User activity logs showing interaction during device connection periods"
