details:
  what: |
    Windows maintains drive letter assignments for storage devices including USB drives and removable media. 
    Correlates drive letters with device identifiers, volume serial numbers, and hardware signatures to 
    ensure consistent assignment across connection sessions.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for correlating USB device connections with file system artifacts, establishing which specific 
    USB device was assigned particular drive letters during file operations. Essential for linking file 
    access artifacts to specific hardware devices and establishing timeline correlations.

  structure: |
    Binary data structures linking drive letters (\\\\DosDevices\\\\C:) to device identifiers and volume 
    information. USB storage devices identified by unique signatures including vendor ID, product ID, 
    and serial numbers embedded in binary format.

  examples:
    - "\\\\DosDevices\\\\E:: USB#VID_0951&PID_1666#50E549C6E258F571&0 (Kingston DataTraveler)"
    - "\\\\DosDevices\\\\F:: USB#VID_090C&PID_1000#12345678&0 (SanDisk Cruzer)"
    - "Volume{GUID}: Device instance path linkage"
    - "Serial: 001CC0EC336BD480&0 (Unique device serial identifier)"
    - "Signature: _??_USBSTOR#Disk&Ven_Kingston&Prod_DataTraveler_3.0&Rev_PMAP"
    - "MountPoint: \\\\??\\\\Volume{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789012}\\\\"

limitations:
  - "Drive letter assignment does NOT prove files were accessed from the device"
  - "Mount point creation doesn't indicate actual file operations occurred"
  - "Device mapping may persist after legitimate usage without indicating data theft"
  - "Drive letter assignment can occur from antivirus scanning without user access"
  - "Multiple assignments don't prove repeated unauthorized access"
  - "Volume mounting doesn't indicate what files were viewed or copied"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_access_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing actual file access or modification on USB device"
    - "ShellBags showing user navigation to specific drive letters"
    - "Recent documents or LNK files pointing to files on assigned drive letters"
    - "Event logs (Event ID 6416) showing successful volume access"
    - "Application logs showing file operations on the mounted drive"

    - "Registry last write times showing device mounting correlation"
    - "Prefetch files showing execution of programs from specific drive letters"
