details:
  what: |
    Windows Terminal modern command-line interface configuration including shell profiles, 
    appearance settings, key bindings, and terminal emulation preferences. Registry stores 
    configuration profiles, color schemes, and integration settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating command-line activities, system administration tasks, and 
    advanced user interactions. Shows evidence of terminal usage patterns, shell preferences, 
    and can reveal system administration activities, scripting development, or command-line based attacks.

  structure: |
    Windows Terminal configuration includes profile definitions, appearance settings, key binding 
    mappings, and startup preferences. Shell integration data tracks context menu additions 
    and command-line interface customizations.

  examples:
    - "DefaultProfile: {PowerShell GUID}"
    - "DefaultProfile: {Command Prompt GUID}"
    - "Profile: PowerShell 7 (Custom PowerShell Core profile)"
    - "Profile: WSL Ubuntu (Windows Subsystem for Linux)"
    - "StartupActions: new-tab --profile PowerShell"
    - "ColorScheme: Campbell (Terminal color theme)"
    - "ContextMenuIntegration: 1 (Right-click context menu enabled)"

limitations:
  - "Windows Terminal configuration does NOT prove command-line programs were executed"
  - "Profile definitions don't indicate shells or commands were actually run"
  - "Context menu integration doesn't show terminal was launched from context menu"
  - "Color scheme and appearance settings don't indicate active terminal usage"
  - "Startup actions configuration doesn't prove terminal was started"
  - "WSL profile existence doesn't prove Linux subsystem was used"
  - "PowerShell profile settings don't indicate PowerShell scripts were executed"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing WindowsTerminal.exe or wt.exe launches"
    - "Command-line history files showing executed commands"
    - "PowerShell or WSL execution logs showing shell activity"
    - "File system artifacts showing command-line tools were run"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing files accessed via command-line tools"
    - "Network connections initiated by command-line programs"
    - "File modifications correlating with terminal session times"
