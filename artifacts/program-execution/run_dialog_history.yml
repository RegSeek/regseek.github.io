details:
  what: |
    Windows Run dialog maintains a Most Recently Used (MRU) list of commands executed through
    the Run interface (Win+R keyboard shortcut). Tracks command execution history including
    system utilities, administrative tools, file paths, network locations, and custom commands
    entered by users for quick access to Windows functionality.

  forensic_value: |
    Extremely valuable for detecting administrative tool usage, malicious command execution,
    system reconnaissance activities, and attempts to access restricted utilities. Shows evidence
    of command-line tool usage, administrative access attempts, and potential privilege escalation
    activities. Critical for understanding user intent and technical knowledge level.

  structure: |
    Sequential lettered values (a, b, c, etc.) containing executed commands as REG_SZ data.
    MRUList value shows execution chronology with most recent commands listed first using
    letter indicators. Commands include full paths, parameters, network locations, and
    built-in Windows utilities.

  examples:
    - "a: cmd (Command Prompt execution)"
    - "b: regedit (Registry Editor access)"
    - "c: gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)"
    - "d: services.msc (Services management console)"
    - "e: \\\\192.168.1.100\\admin$ (Network administrative share)"
    - "f: powershell -enc [base64] (PowerShell encoded command)"
    - "g: C:\\temp\\malware.exe (Suspicious executable execution)"
    - "MRUList: gfedcba (chronological order, newest first)"

limitations:
  - "Run dialog history does NOT prove commands were successfully executed"
  - "Command entries don't indicate successful program launch or completion"
  - "Network paths don't prove successful authentication or resource access"
  - "Administrative tool entries don't show actual system configuration changes"
  - "Command parameters don't indicate successful operation or output"
  - "MRU order doesn't show command execution frequency or duration"
  - "Suspicious executables don't prove malicious activity occurred"
