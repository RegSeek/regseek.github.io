details:
  what: |
    AmCache.hve registry hive tracks metadata about executables, installed applications, 
    and drivers including file paths, SHA1 hashes, compilation times, and program information. 
    Contains InventoryApplication, InventoryApplicationFile, and InventoryDriverBinary entries.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for proving file presence on system even if deleted. Contains SHA1 hashes 
    for malware identification and compilation timestamps for threat actor correlation. 
    More detailed than ShimCache with richer metadata for identifying renamed executables 
    and tracking software installation patterns.

  structure: |
    Registry hive containing multiple keys with structured data format. Each entry includes 
    FileID (SHA1 hash), file path, size, compilation time, program details, and binary 
    version information stored with rich forensic metadata.

  examples:
    - "Path: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\malware.exe"
    - "SHA1: 9c07abbdd1faa019708cfb54a778748077fe13e3"
    - "CompileTime: 2024-01-10 15:30:45"
    - "Size: 1,048,576 bytes"
    - "Publisher: Unknown Publisher"
    - "Product: Suspicious Application"
    - "BinaryType: 64-bit"
    - "Language: English (United States)"

limitations:
  - "AmCache entry does NOT prove program execution - only shows file was present on system"
  - "File metadata can be modified or spoofed by malware authors"
  - "File metadata correlation requires verification against known malware databases"
  - "Compilation timestamps can be altered to evade detection"
  - "File presence doesn't indicate when or if the file was actually executed"
  - "Renamed executables may retain original metadata from before renaming"
  - "Administrative installation may populate AmCache without user execution"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs (Event ID 4688) showing actual program launch"
    - "Prefetch files (.pf) with execution counters and file references"
    - "Application event logs showing successful program startup"
    - "EDR/monitoring tool process execution logs"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "ShimCache entries with matching file paths and timestamps"
    - "UserAssist showing user-initiated program launches"
    - "Network connections initiated by programs with matching hashes"
    - "File modifications with timestamps correlating to program activity"
