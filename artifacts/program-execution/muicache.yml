details:
  what: |
    Windows MUICache stores friendly display names of executed programs for multilingual 
    interface support. Tracks applications that have been run by caching their localized 
    names, descriptions, and version information for proper UI display regardless of system language.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides evidence of program execution with human-readable application names. 
    Complements other execution artifacts by showing what programs were actually launched 
    with their proper names. Useful for identifying renamed executables, suspicious programs 
    masquerading as legitimate software, and portable applications.

  structure: |
    Full executable paths as value names with corresponding friendly names as REG_SZ value data. 
    Includes both system programs and user applications. Cache persists across reboots and 
    system updates. Path format includes drive letters and full directory structures.

  examples:
    - "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe: Command Prompt"
    - "C:\\Program Files\\Notepad++\\notepad++.exe: Notepad++"
    - "C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\malware.exe: Suspicious Application"
    - "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe: Windows Explorer"
    - "D:\\PortableApps\\Firefox\\firefox.exe: Mozilla Firefox"
    - "C:\\Tools\\SysinternalsSuite\\procexp.exe: Process Explorer"
    - "C:\\Temp\\renamed_calc.exe: Calculator"
    - "\\\\server\\tools\\admin_tool.exe: Network Administration Tool"

limitations:
  - "MUICache entry does NOT prove program execution - only shows Windows accessed executable for name lookup"
  - "Entries created by file browsing, antivirus scanning, or system indexing without execution"
  - "Windows Explorer preview pane and file property access populate cache"
  - "Administrative tools and system utilities may populate cache during maintenance"
  - "Portable applications may not create entries if not launched through Windows shell"
  - "Cache may be cleared by system cleanup utilities or manual registry editing"
  - "Renamed executables may retain original application display names"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs (Event ID 4688) showing actual program launch"
    - "Prefetch files (.pf) with execution counters and file references"
    - "Application event logs confirming successful program startup"
    - "UserAssist entries showing user-initiated program launches"
