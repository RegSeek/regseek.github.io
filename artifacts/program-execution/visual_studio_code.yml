details:
  what: |
    Visual Studio Code development environment configuration including workspace settings, 
    installed extensions, recent projects, and debugging configurations. Registry manages 
    file associations, protocol handlers, and installation data.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for investigating software development activities, code editing patterns, and 
    project access. Shows evidence of code development, extension usage, workspace access, 
    and can reveal unauthorized code modifications, software project involvement, and programming activities.

  structure: |
    VS Code configuration includes installation directories, file associations, protocol handlers, 
    and workspace preferences. Extension data tracks installed development tools and language support.

  examples:
    - "InstallLocation: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Microsoft VS Code"
    - "FileAssociation: .py -> Visual Studio Code"
    - "FileAssociation: .js -> Visual Studio Code"
    - "ProtocolHandler: vscode:// (VS Code URL protocol)"
    - "RecentWorkspace: C:\\Development\\ProjectName"
    - "RecentWorkspace: \\\\server\\shared\\source-code"
    - "Extension: ms-python.python (Python development support)"

limitations:
  - "VS Code registry entries do NOT prove active code development or editing"
  - "Installation presence doesn't indicate actual programming work was performed"
  - "File associations may be set without opening or editing code files"
  - "Recent workspace entries don't prove code was modified or created"
  - "Extension installation doesn't indicate extension was actively used"
  - "Protocol handler registration enables VS Code integration but doesn't show usage"
  - "Workspace settings may be configured without actual development activity"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing Code.exe launches"
    - "File system artifacts showing code files accessed or modified"
    - "Recent documents showing programming files opened in VS Code"
    - "VS Code workspace and settings files showing actual configuration"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Git artifacts showing code commits and version control activity"
    - "File modification timestamps correlating with VS Code execution"
    - "Network logs showing extension downloads or updates"
