details:
  what: |
    Git version control configuration including user credentials, repository settings, 
    remote URLs, and development workflow preferences. Registry tracks installation paths, 
    global configuration, credential helpers, and integration settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating software development activities, source code access, and 
    intellectual property theft. Shows evidence of repository cloning, commit activity, 
    and can reveal unauthorized code access, stolen source code, or insider development activities.

  structure: |
    Git configuration includes installation directories, user identity settings, credential 
    storage methods, repository paths, and integration preferences. Global configuration 
    shows default behavior and authentication methods.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\Git"
    - "GitConfig: user.name=John Developer"
    - "GitConfig: user.email=john@company.com"
    - "GitConfig: credential.helper=manager-core"
    - "RecentRepo: https://github.com/company/sensitive-project.git"
    - "RecentRepo: git@internal-server:proprietary-code.git"
    - "GitBash: C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe"

limitations:
  - "Git registry configuration does NOT prove actual repository usage or code commits"
  - "Installation presence doesn't indicate active development work"
  - "User credentials may be configured without accessing any repositories"
  - "Repository URLs in configuration don't prove successful cloning or access"
  - "Credential helpers may store authentication without actual Git operations"
  - "Configuration may be set by automated tools or installers"
  - "Recent repository lists may be populated without successful operations"

correlation:

    - "Git log files showing actual commit, push, and pull operations"
