details:
  what: |
    Windows File History service provides automated backup and versioning for user files, documents, 
    pictures, music, and desktop contents. Configuration includes backup destinations, inclusion/exclusion 
    rules, backup frequency, retention policies, and network backup locations for comprehensive 
    data protection and file recovery.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for data recovery investigations, timeline reconstruction using historical file versions, 
    and detecting attempts to hide evidence through file deletion. File History configuration reveals 
    backup locations that may contain deleted evidence and shows user data protection awareness.

  structure: |
    File History configuration includes TargetUrl (backup destination), LocalUserConfigPath 
    (configuration location), ProtectedFolders (included directories), ExcludedFolders (excluded 
    directories), and backup frequency settings. Policy configurations control enterprise backup 
    enforcement and retention periods.

  examples:
    - "TargetUrl: D:\\FileHistory (Local drive backup destination)"
    - "TargetUrl: \\\\\\\\server\\\\backups\\\\user (Network backup location)"
    - "ConfigStatus: 0 (File History not configured)"
    - "ConfigStatus: 2 (File History enabled and running)"
    - "FrequencyInHours: 1 (Hourly backup frequency)"
    - "RetainedVersions: 720 (Retain versions for 720 hours/30 days)"
    - "ExcludedFolders: AppData, .git, node_modules (Excluded folder patterns)"
    - "LastBackupTime: 2024-01-20 15:30:25 UTC (Most recent backup)"

limitations:
  - "File History configuration does NOT prove backup operations actually occurred"
  - "Backup destination settings don't indicate successful file backup completion"
  - "Retention policies don't prove historical file versions are available"
  - "Backup frequency settings don't indicate actual backup execution success"
  - "Configuration status may show enabled but backups could be failing"
  - "Excluded folder settings don't prove files were intentionally hidden from backup"

  required_for_definitive_backup_proof:

    - "Event logs showing File History service execution and backup operations"
    - "File system artifacts showing backup destination activity and file transfers"
    - "Registry changes showing File History configuration during backup periods"
    - "Process execution logs showing File History service running during backup times"

    - "Network logs showing backup traffic to configured network destinations"
    - "Registry changes showing File History status updates during backup operations"
    - "Event logs showing backup success or failure events"
