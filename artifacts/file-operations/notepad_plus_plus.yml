details:
  what: |
    Notepad++ text editor stores configuration including recent file lists, session data,
    plugin configurations, and editing preferences. Registry tracks document access patterns,
    programming language usage, and workspace settings for text editing activity analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating source code access, configuration file modifications, and
    script development. Shows evidence of programming activity, configuration file editing,
    and document modification patterns. Can reveal development work, system administration
    activities, or evidence of script-based attacks.

  structure: |
    Notepad++ configuration includes recent file paths, session restoration data, language
    syntax settings, plugin configurations, and find/replace history. File history shows
    accessed documents and editing sessions for comprehensive text editing behavior analysis.

  examples:
    - "RecentFiles: C:\\Scripts\\malware_payload.py"
    - "RecentFiles: C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts"
    - "RecentFiles: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\passwords.txt"
    - "Session\\File0: C:\\Development\\source_code.cpp"
    - "FindHistory: SELECT * FROM users WHERE admin=1"
    - "ReplaceHistory: password123 -> ********"
    - "Language: Python (Programming language syntax)"

limitations:
  - "Recent file lists do NOT prove files were actually edited or modified"
  - "Session data doesn't indicate successful file saving or content changes"
  - "Find/replace history doesn't show operations were successfully executed"
  - "File paths may reference non-existent or inaccessible files"
  - "Recent files don't indicate duration of editing or extent of modifications"
  - "Plugin configurations don't show plugins were actively used"
  - "Language settings don't prove programming or scripting activity occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_editing_proof:
    - "File system timestamps showing actual file modifications during Notepad++ usage"
    - "Process execution logs showing Notepad++ application startup and activity"
    - "File content analysis showing changes consistent with text editing"
    - "Application event logs showing successful file opening and saving operations"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing text files accessed outside of Notepad++"
    - "Registry keys or system files modified correlating with configuration editing"
    - "Backup files or version history showing progressive file modifications"
    - "Network activity logs correlating with script execution or file transfers"
