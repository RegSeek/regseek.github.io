details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks recently accessed documents and files to populate recent items in applications,
    Start menu, and taskbar jump lists. Stores file paths, access order, file metadata, and
    shell link information. Maintains separate tracking for different file types and includes
    both local and network file access.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows what files a user has recently opened, indicating work patterns, data access, and
    potential data exfiltration activities. Can reveal sensitive documents accessed, unauthorized
    file access, and evidence of specific work activities. Critical for intellectual property
    theft investigations and user behavior analysis.

  structure: |
    Binary data containing file paths, shell link information, and access metadata. MRUListEx
    value shows access order with most recent first (0-based indexing). File extensions get
    separate subkeys for organization. Data includes full file paths, network locations, and
    associated metadata stored in shell item format.

  examples:
    - "Extension: .pdf - C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\financial_report.pdf"
    - "Extension: .docx - \\\\server\\HR\\employee_records.docx"
    - "Extension: .xlsx - D:\\USB\\confidential_data.xlsx"
    - "Network file: \\\\fileserver.company.com\\shared\\strategy.pptx"
    - "Local file: C:\\Temp\\downloaded_document.pdf"
    - "MRUListEx: 0,3,1,2 (most recent access order)"
    - "File metadata: Size, modification date, attributes"
    - "Access timestamp: 2024-01-20 15:30:45"

limitations:
  - "Recent document entries do NOT prove files were actually opened or viewed"
  - "File paths don't indicate successful file access or content viewing"
  - "Access order doesn't show duration of file interaction or editing"
  - "Network file entries don't prove successful authentication or download"
  - "Recent docs don't indicate what operations were performed on files"
  - "Metadata doesn't show file content was accessed or modified"
  - "Shell link information may reference non-existent or moved files"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_file_access_proof:
    - "File system timestamps showing actual file modifications or access"
    - "Application event logs showing successful document opening and editing"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications performing file operations"
    - "File content analysis showing user interaction or modification"
