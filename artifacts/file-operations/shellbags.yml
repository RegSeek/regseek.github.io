details:
  what: |
    ShellBags track Windows Explorer navigation history, folder view preferences, window
    positions, column sorting options, and folder access patterns. Records evidence of folders
    accessed even if they no longer exist on the system. Stores metadata about folder structures
    and user interaction patterns with the file system.

  forensic_value: |
    Proves user accessed specific folders, shows folder structure of deleted directories, reveals
    navigation patterns, and provides evidence of external storage device usage. Critical for
    proving folder access and user activity. Can reveal access to sensitive directories, network
    shares, and removable media. Essential for timeline reconstruction.

  structure: |
    Hierarchical folder structure with numbered bag entries containing view preferences,
    access timestamps, and folder properties. BagMRU maintains most recently used folder list
    with PIDL (Pointer to Item IDentifier List) data. Each bag contains window size, view mode,
    column widths, and sorting preferences.

  examples:
    - "Bag 1: Desktop folder settings (Icon view, large icons)"
    - "Bag 15: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Sensitive (Details view)"
    - "Bag 23: \\\\server\\confidential (network folder access)"
    - "Bag 45: E:\\ (USB drive - Kingston DataTraveler)"
    - "MRU Entry: USB drive folder structure"
    - "View: Details mode, sorted by date modified"
    - "Position: Window at 100,100 size 800x600"
    - "Columns: Name, Date Modified, Type, Size"

limitations:
  - "ShellBags do NOT prove files were accessed or modified within folders"
  - "Folder navigation doesn't indicate duration of folder interaction"
  - "View preferences don't show successful file operations were performed"
  - "Network folder entries don't prove successful authentication or file access"
  - "USB device entries don't indicate what files were accessed on removable media"
  - "Deleted folder evidence doesn't show when folders were actually deleted"
  - "Window positioning doesn't prove active folder usage or file manipulation"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_file_access_proof:
    - "File system timestamps showing actual file modifications in navigated folders"
    - "Recent documents showing files accessed from folders in ShellBags"
    - "OpenSaveMRU entries showing file operations in navigated locations"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications accessing files in these folders"

    - "USB device registry entries showing removable media connections"
    - "Network share access logs correlating with network folder navigation"
