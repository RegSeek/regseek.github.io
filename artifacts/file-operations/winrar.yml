details:
  what: |
    WinRAR archive utility stores configuration including recent archive files, extraction paths,
    compression settings, and file association preferences. Registry tracks archive creation/
    extraction activity, password usage patterns, temporary file locations, and compression
    preferences for comprehensive archive tool usage analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data packaging for exfiltration, evidence destruction through
    compression, password-protected archive usage, and file transfer preparation. Shows evidence
    of archive creation/extraction activity, reveals potentially suspicious file packaging, and
    can indicate data theft preparation or evidence concealment.

  structure: |
    WinRAR configuration includes recent archive lists, default extraction paths, compression
    levels, password settings, and file association data. Archive history shows processed files,
    extraction locations, and access patterns for comprehensive archive tool behavior analysis
    and data handling tracking.

  examples:
    - "ArcHistory: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\sensitive_data.rar"
    - "ArcHistory: C:\\Temp\\exfiltration_package.zip"
    - "ExtrPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\extracted\\"
    - "Compression: 3 (Normal compression level)"
    - "SavePaths: 1 (Save extraction paths)"
    - "Password: (Encrypted password usage indicator)"
    - "TempPath: C:\\Temp\\WinRAR\\ (Temporary extraction location)"

limitations:
  - "WinRAR configuration does NOT prove archives were actually created or extracted"
  - "Archive history doesn't indicate successful compression or extraction operations"
  - "Password settings don't prove password-protected archives were created"
  - "Extraction paths don't show files were successfully extracted or accessed"
  - "Compression levels don't indicate actual archive creation occurred"
  - "Temporary file settings don't prove temporary files were created or processed"
  - "File associations don't show archive files were opened or processed"

    - "Registry keys modified during archive operations"
    - "File system timestamps showing archive creation/extraction times"
    - "ShellBags showing folder navigation to archive locations"
