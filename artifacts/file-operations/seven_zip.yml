details:
  what: |
    7-Zip archive utility stores configuration including compression settings, file associations,
    context menu integration, and archive handling preferences. Registry tracks archive creation/
    extraction activity, compression algorithms, password usage, and interface customizations
    for comprehensive archive tool usage analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data packaging for exfiltration, evidence destruction through
    compression, password-protected archive creation, and file transfer preparation. Shows
    evidence of archive manipulation, compression activities, and can indicate data theft
    preparation or evidence concealment through compressed archive usage.

  structure: |
    7-Zip configuration includes compression level preferences, archive format settings,
    password protection usage, context menu integration, and file association data. Archive
    history shows processed files, compression ratios, and extraction activities for
    comprehensive archive tool behavior analysis.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip"
    - "CompressionLevel: 5 (Normal compression)"
    - "ArchiveFormat: 7z (Default archive format)"
    - "ContextMenu: 1 (Explorer context menu integration)"
    - "FileAssociation: .7z -> 7-Zip File Manager"
    - "FileAssociation: .rar -> 7-Zip File Manager"
    - "SolidArchive: 1 (Solid compression enabled)"
    - "EncryptionMethod: AES-256 (Archive encryption method)"

limitations:
  - "7-Zip configuration does NOT prove archives were actually created or extracted"
  - "File associations don't indicate archive files were opened or processed"
  - "Compression settings don't show actual compression operations occurred"
  - "Context menu integration doesn't prove right-click operations were used"
  - "Encryption method settings don't indicate password-protected archives were created"
  - "Installation path doesn't show 7-Zip was actively used for file operations"
  - "Format preferences don't prove specific archive types were created"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:
    - "File system artifacts showing created or extracted archive files"
    - "Process execution logs showing 7-Zip application startup and activity"
    - "Temporary files showing archive processing operations"
    - "Event logs showing file operations correlating with archive activity"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing archive files accessed through 7-Zip"
    - "Registry keys modified during archive operations"
    - "File system timestamps showing archive creation/extraction times"
    - "Command-line history showing 7z.exe usage"
