details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks the last visited folders when applications use standard file dialog boxes,
    along with the executable name that opened each folder location. Shows detailed folder
    navigation patterns and application-specific file access in chronological order.

  forensic_value: |
    Links specific applications to folder locations they accessed, showing user navigation
    patterns and attempts to access restricted areas. Can indicate data staging, reconnaissance
    activities, or exfiltration preparation. Critical for proving application-specific folder
    access and understanding user behavior patterns.

  structure: |
    Sequential entries containing executable name followed by folder path data in binary PIDL
    (Pointer to Item IDentifier List) format. MRUListEx shows access order with most recent
    first. Each entry links a specific program to the folder location it accessed.

  examples:
    - "Entry 0: notepad.exe -> C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\Sensitive"
    - "Entry 1: winrar.exe -> \\\\server\\confidential\\archives"
    - "Entry 2: cmd.exe -> C:\\Windows\\System32"
    - "Entry 3: malware.exe -> C:\\Temp\\Staging"
    - "Entry 4: excel.exe -> \\\\fileserver\\finance\\reports"
    - "MRUListEx: 4,3,2,1,0 (most recent access order)"
    - "Network access: powershell.exe -> \\\\192.168.1.100\\admin$"
    - "USB access: explorer.exe -> E:\\USB_Drive\\confidential"

limitations:
  - "Folder visits do NOT prove files were accessed, opened, or modified"
  - "Application association doesn't indicate successful file operations"
  - "PIDL entries may reflect browsing without file selection or interaction"
  - "Folder access doesn't show duration of stay or specific files viewed"
  - "Executable names can be spoofed or renamed to hide actual program identity"
  - "Network folder entries don't prove successful authentication or file access"
  - "MRU order doesn't indicate frequency or importance of folder usage"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_file_access_proof:
    - "File system access logs showing actual file operations in visited folders"
    - "Application event logs showing successful file opening and editing"
    - "Process execution logs confirming applications performed file operations"
    - "File modification timestamps correlating with folder visit times"

    - "OpenSaveMRU entries showing specific files accessed in these folders"
    - "Recent documents showing files from folders visited by applications"
    - "ShellBags data showing detailed folder navigation and file interaction"
