details:
  what: |
    Windows records search terms typed in the Start menu search box to provide autocomplete
    functionality and search suggestions. Maintains chronological history of user search
    queries across system searches, application searches, settings searches, and file searches
    initiated through the Start menu interface.

  forensic_value: |
    Extremely valuable for understanding user intent, revealing what files, applications, or
    system utilities users were searching for. Can show evidence of attempts to find specific
    tools for malicious purposes, searches for confidential information, administrative utilities,
    or attempts to locate and execute suspicious programs. Provides direct insight into user
    behavior patterns.

  structure: |
    Sequential numbered values (0, 1, 2, etc.) containing search terms as REG_SZ data.
    MRUListEx value shows search chronology with most recent searches listed first.
    Search terms persist across user sessions and system reboots, maintaining complete
    search history until manually cleared or overwritten.

  examples:
    - "0: cmd (Command Prompt search)"
    - "1: powershell (PowerShell search)"
    - "2: regedit (Registry Editor search)"
    - "3: confidential documents (File search)"
    - "4: malware.exe (Suspicious executable search)"
    - "5: administrative tools (System utilities search)"
    - "6: control panel (Settings search)"
    - "MRUListEx: 6,5,4,3,2,1,0 (chronological order, newest first)"

limitations:
  - "Search queries do NOT prove search results were accessed or executed"
  - "Search terms don't indicate successful application launch or file access"
  - "Administrative tool searches don't prove system configuration was modified"
  - "File searches don't show files were found, opened, or accessed"
  - "Malicious-looking searches don't prove malicious activity occurred"
  - "Query chronology doesn't indicate search result selection or usage"
  - "Search history doesn't show search success or failure"
