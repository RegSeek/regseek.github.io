details:
  what: |
    Windows Jump Lists display recently accessed files, frequent destinations, and custom tasks
    for applications pinned to the taskbar and Start menu. Registry settings control jump list
    behavior, recent items tracking, and privacy configurations.

  forensic_value: |
    Jump list registry settings reveal if users disabled activity tracking to hide their behavior,
    shows privacy-conscious modifications, and indicates attempts to conceal file access patterns.
    While actual jump list data is stored in files, registry settings show configuration changes
    that affect evidence preservation.

  structure: |
    Advanced Explorer settings include Start_TrackDocs (document tracking), Start_TrackProgs
    (program tracking), JumpListItems_Maximum (item limits), and Start_ShowRecentDocs (recent docs).
    Values stored as REG_DWORD with 1=enabled, 0=disabled.

  examples:
    - "Start_TrackDocs: 0 (Recent documents tracking disabled)"
    - "Start_TrackProgs: 0 (Recent programs tracking disabled)"
    - "JumpListItems_Maximum: 10 (Maximum 10 items per jump list)"
    - "Start_ShowRecentDocs: 0 (Hide recent documents in Start menu)"
    - "TaskbarGlomLevel: 1 (Group similar taskbar buttons)"
    - "EnableAutoTray: 1 (Hide inactive notification icons)"

limitations:
  - "Jump list settings do NOT show what files or programs were actually accessed"
  - "Disabled tracking doesn't prevent all activity logging by other Windows components"
  - "Configuration changes don't indicate when actual jump list usage occurred"
  - "Privacy settings may be overridden by group policy or system administrators"
  - "Maximum item settings don't show actual jump list contents or usage"
  - "Tracking disablement may not be user-initiated (could be system default)"
  - "Settings don't reveal the effectiveness of privacy attempts"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_usage_proof:

    - "Windows Event Logs showing application launch patterns"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents registry entries showing file access despite disabled tracking"
    - "ShellBags showing folder navigation correlating with jump list preferences"
    - "UserAssist entries showing program execution despite disabled program tracking"
    - "OpenSaveMRU entries showing file operations independent of jump list settings"
