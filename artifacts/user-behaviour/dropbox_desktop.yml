details:
  what: |
    Dropbox Desktop Client manages file synchronization configuration including sync
    folder locations, account authentication, selective sync preferences, bandwidth
    controls, and LAN sync settings. Registry stores installation paths, user credentials,
    and team folder configurations.

  forensic_value: |
    Essential for investigating data exfiltration through Dropbox and unauthorized file
    sharing. Shows evidence of Dropbox usage patterns, shared folder access, team
    memberships, and potential data leakage vectors. Can reveal deliberate data theft
    through personal Dropbox accounts or unauthorized sharing of sensitive information.

  structure: |
    Dropbox configuration includes account identifiers, sync folder paths, selective
    sync exclusions, bandwidth settings, LAN sync preferences, and Smart Sync policies.
    Team configuration shows business account integration and shared folder access.

  examples:
    - "DropboxPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Dropbox"
    - "AccountEmail: user@company.com (Business Dropbox account)"
    - "AccountEmail: personal@email.com (Personal Dropbox account)"
    - "SelectiveSync: {Private, Confidential} (Excluded folders)"
    - "LanSync: 1 (Local network synchronization enabled)"
    - "SmartSync: 1 (Online-only files enabled)"
    - "BandwidthLimit: 100 (Upload limit in KB/s)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual files synced or shared"
  - "Account email doesn't prove active file synchronization occurred"
  - "Selective sync settings may not reflect current folder exclusions"
  - "Personal and business account mixing may obscure actual usage patterns"
