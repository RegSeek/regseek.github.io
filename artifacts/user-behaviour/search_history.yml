details:
  what: |
    Windows Search service maintains comprehensive configuration for file indexing, search
    behavior, crawl scope management, and search preferences. Controls which files and locations
    are searchable, file type filters, search result preferences, and privacy settings for
    both local and network resources.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding user search patterns, data access intentions, and information-seeking
    behavior. Shows what locations were indexed for search capabilities and reveals search
    preferences that might indicate user intent to hide or find specific data types. Configuration
    changes may indicate attempts to hide data from search.

  structure: |
    Search configuration includes indexed location rules (CrawlScopeManager), file type filters,
    search preferences, and privacy settings. CrawlScopeManager contains inclusion and exclusion
    rules with scope definitions for local drives, network paths, and specific folders.

  examples:
    - "IndexedLocations: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"
    - "ExcludedPaths: C:\\Windows\\Temp, C:\\Program Files"
    - "EnableWebSearchInHistory: 1 (Web search enabled)"
    - "SearchHistory: 1 (Search history tracking enabled)"
    - "PrivacyMode: 0 (Privacy mode disabled)"
    - "IndexerState: 2 (Indexing service running)"
    - "CrawlIncludePatterns: *.pdf, *.docx, *.xlsx"
    - "NetworkIndexing: 0 (Network locations excluded from indexing)"

limitations:
  - "Search configuration does NOT prove search functionality was actually used"
  - "Indexed locations don't indicate files were searched for or found"
  - "Privacy settings don't show what search queries were made"
  - "Excluded paths don't prove files were hidden intentionally"
  - "Indexing service status doesn't indicate search activity occurred"
  - "File type filters don't show specific files were indexed or searched"
  - "Network indexing settings don't prove network resources were accessed"

    - "Application usage patterns correlating with search configuration"
    - "Registry keys modified during search service configuration"
