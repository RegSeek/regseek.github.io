details:
  what: |
    Windows Search service maintains comprehensive configuration for file indexing, search
    behavior, crawl scope management, and search preferences. Controls which files and locations
    are searchable, file type filters, search result preferences, and privacy settings for
    both local and network resources.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for understanding search service configuration and indexing policies that may
    affect evidence collection. Shows what locations are configured for indexing and search
    privacy settings that might impact investigation scope. Note: This artifact contains
    configuration settings only, NOT actual search queries or user search history.

  structure: |
    Search configuration includes indexed location rules (CrawlScopeManager), file type filters,
    search preferences, and privacy settings. CrawlScopeManager contains inclusion and exclusion
    rules with scope definitions for local drives, network paths, and specific folders.

  examples:
    - "IndexedLocations: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"
    - "ExcludedPaths: C:\\Windows\\Temp, C:\\Program Files"
    - "EnableWebSearchInHistory: 1 (Web search enabled)"
    - "SearchHistory: 1 (Search history tracking enabled)"
    - "PrivacyMode: 0 (Privacy mode disabled)"
    - "IndexerState: 2 (Indexing service running)"
    - "CrawlIncludePatterns: *.pdf, *.docx, *.xlsx"
    - "NetworkIndexing: 0 (Network locations excluded from indexing)"

limitations:
  - "Configuration settings do NOT contain actual search queries or search history"
  - "Indexed locations do NOT prove files were searched for or found"
  - "Privacy settings do NOT show what search queries were made"
  - "Excluded paths do NOT prove files were hidden intentionally"
  - "Indexing service status does NOT indicate search activity occurred"
  - "File type filters do NOT show specific files were indexed or searched"
  - "Network indexing settings do NOT prove network resources were accessed"
  - "These registry settings only show configuration, NOT user search behavior or patterns"
