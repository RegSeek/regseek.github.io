details:
  what: |
    Box Sync and Box Drive manage enterprise cloud storage synchronization including
    folder mapping, authentication with Box enterprise accounts, collaboration settings,
    and security policies. Registry tracks installation configurations, user credentials,
    and folder sync preferences.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating enterprise data exfiltration and unauthorized access to
    Box repositories. Shows evidence of Box usage in enterprise environments, shared
    folder access, and potential data leakage through Box platform. Essential for
    analyzing insider threats in corporate settings.

  structure: |
    Box configuration includes enterprise account identifiers, sync folder locations,
    collaboration permissions, security settings, and Box Edit integration preferences.
    Enterprise policies control access restrictions and sharing permissions.

  examples:
    - "BoxSyncPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Box Sync"
    - "BoxDrivePath: B:\\ (Box Drive mount point)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual files shared or accessed"
  - "Enterprise account presence doesn't prove data exfiltration occurred"
  - "Collaboration settings don't indicate actual collaboration activity"
