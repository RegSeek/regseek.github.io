details:
  what: |
    VLC Media Player stores configuration including recent media files, playlists, playback
    preferences, subtitle settings, and file associations. Registry tracks media consumption
    patterns, network streaming usage, codec preferences, and interface customizations for
    comprehensive media player behavior analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating media consumption patterns, potential copyright violations,
    network streaming activity, and evidence of specific media file access. Shows evidence
    of video/audio content consumption, network media streaming, and can reveal timeline
    information about user media activities. Useful for behavioral analysis.

  structure: |
    VLC configuration includes recent media lists, interface preferences, codec settings,
    network stream URLs, subtitle configurations, and file association data. Recent items
    show media file paths, network streams, and access timestamps for comprehensive media
    consumption analysis and user behavior profiling.

limitations:
  - "VLC configuration does NOT prove media files were actually played or viewed"
  - "Recent media lists don't indicate successful media playback or completion"
  - "Network stream URLs don't prove streams were accessed or viewed"
  - "Codec settings don't show media content was successfully decoded or played"
  - "File associations don't indicate media files were opened through VLC"
  - "Playlist settings don't prove playlists were created or used"
  - "Interface preferences don't show active media consumption occurred"

correlation:
