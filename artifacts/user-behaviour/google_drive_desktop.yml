details:
  what: |
    Google Drive Desktop Client stores synchronization configuration including sync
    folder locations, account authentication data, selective sync preferences, bandwidth
    settings, and file stream configurations. Registry tracks installation paths,
    user accounts, and Google Workspace integration.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration through Google Drive and unauthorized
    file sharing to personal accounts. Shows evidence of Google Drive usage patterns,
    synced folder locations, account associations, and potential data leakage vectors.
    Can reveal exposure of sensitive corporate data through personal Google accounts.

  structure: |
    Google Drive configuration includes account identifiers, sync root paths, selective
    sync folder lists, bandwidth throttling settings, and Drive File Stream mounting
    options. Installation data provides version information and integration settings.

  examples:
    - "SyncRootPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Google Drive"
    - "Account: user@company.com (Google Workspace account)"
    - "Account: personal@gmail.com (Personal Google account)"
    - "DriveFS MountPoint: G:\\ (Drive File Stream mount)"
    - "SelectiveSync: {folder1, folder2} (Only specific folders synchronized)"
    - "BandwidthRx: 1024 (Download bandwidth limit in KB/s)"
    - "BandwidthTx: 512 (Upload bandwidth limit in KB/s)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual files synced or shared"
  - "Account presence doesn't prove active data synchronization occurred"
  - "Selective sync settings may not reflect current folder selections"
  - "Multiple account configurations may obscure actual usage patterns"
