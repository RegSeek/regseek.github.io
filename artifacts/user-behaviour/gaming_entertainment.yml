details:
  what: |
    Windows gaming and entertainment infrastructure including Xbox Live integration, Game Bar
    functionality, game recording capabilities, and gaming performance optimization. Controls
    game mode behavior, screen recording, and social gaming features.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for behavioral analysis and user profiling. Gaming activity patterns can establish
    user presence and reveal social connections through gaming platforms. Game recordings and
    screenshots may contain inadvertent evidence, while gaming-related network activity can
    reveal communication patterns.

  structure: |
    Game Bar configuration includes recording settings, hotkey assignments, and overlay preferences.
    GameDVR manages game capture functionality and storage locations. Xbox integration contains
    account information and social features. Graphics drivers control hardware acceleration.

  examples:
    - "GameBar\\AppCaptureEnabled: 1 (Game recording enabled)"
    - "GameBar\\AudioCaptureEnabled: 1 (Audio recording in game clips)"
    - "GameDVR\\AudioEncodingBitrate: 128000 (Audio quality setting)"
    - "GameDVR\\VideoEncodingBitrateMode: 2 (High quality video recording)"
    - "Xbox\\SignedInUser: user@outlook.com (Xbox Live account)"
    - "GameMode: 1 (Windows Game Mode enabled)"
    - "RecordingFolder: C:\\Users\\user\\Videos\\Captures (Game clip storage)"

limitations:
  - "Gaming configuration does NOT prove games were actually played"
  - "Recording settings don't indicate actual game capture or recording activity"
  - "Xbox account presence doesn't show active gaming or social interaction"
  - "Game mode enablement doesn't prove gaming performance optimization was used"
  - "Capture folder settings don't indicate recordings were created or saved"
  - "Audio/video settings don't show actual multimedia capture occurred"
  - "Graphics optimization settings don't prove enhanced gaming performance"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_gaming_proof:
    - "Game capture files showing actual recorded gameplay sessions"
