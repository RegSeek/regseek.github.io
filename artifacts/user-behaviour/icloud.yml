details:
  what: |
    iCloud for Windows enables synchronization between Windows computers and Apple's
    iCloud services including iCloud Drive, Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendar, and
    Bookmarks. Registry stores Apple ID authentication, sync preferences, and
    storage locations for data sharing between Windows and Apple devices.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating data synchronization between Windows systems and Apple
    devices, cross-platform data exfiltration, and unauthorized access to Apple
    ecosystem data. Shows evidence of iCloud usage and potential data leakage
    between corporate Windows systems and personal Apple devices.

  structure: |
    iCloud configuration includes Apple ID credentials, sync service enablement
    (Drive, Photos, Mail, Contacts, Calendar), storage locations, and device
    associations. Integration settings control Windows Explorer and Outlook
    synchronization with iCloud services.

  examples:
    - "AppleID: user@icloud.com (Associated Apple ID)"
    - "iCloudDrive: 1 (iCloud Drive sync enabled)"
    - "Photos: 1 (iCloud Photos sync enabled)"
    - "Mail: 0 (iCloud Mail sync disabled)"
    - "Contacts: 1 (Contact synchronization enabled)"
    - "Calendar: 1 (Calendar sync with Outlook enabled)"
    - "BookmarkSync: 1 (Safari bookmark synchronization)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows configuration only, not actual synced content or activity"
  - "Enabled services don't prove active synchronization occurred"
  - "Apple ID presence doesn't indicate frequency or volume of data sync"
  - "Cross-platform sync may bypass traditional Windows logging"
