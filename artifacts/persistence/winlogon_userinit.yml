details:
  what: |
    Winlogon registry keys control the Windows logon process including which
    programs run during user logon, desktop shell initialization, and system
    notification handlers. Userinit and Shell values specify programs that execute
    automatically when users log in. Notify subkeys register DLLs for logon/logoff
    event notifications. These mechanisms are fundamental to Windows startup process.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical persistence mechanism used by advanced malware and sophisticated attackers.
    Shows unauthorized modifications to the logon process that ensure malware execution
    on every user login. Difficult to detect and highly effective for maintaining access.
    Can indicate system compromise, privilege escalation, and advanced persistent threats.
    Essential for identifying rootkits and advanced malware families.

  structure: |
    Key values include Userinit (programs run during logon initialization),
    Shell (desktop shell program), Notify DLL registrations, and system policies.
    Values contain comma-separated executable paths with parameters. Binary data
    may include security descriptors and policy enforcement mechanisms.

  examples:
    - "Userinit: C:\\Windows\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "Shell: explorer.exe,C:\\temp\\malicious.exe"
    - "Notify\\malware_notify\\DllName: evil_notify.dll"
    - "AutoAdminLogon: 1 (automatic login enabled)"
    - "DefaultUserName: administrator"
    - "LegalNoticeCaption: System Security Notice"
    - "LegalNoticeText: Authorized use only"
    - "VmApplet: rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL appwiz.cpl"
