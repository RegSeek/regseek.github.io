details:
  what: |
    Windows screensaver configuration including screensaver executable path,
    timeout settings, password protection, and screensaver-related security
    settings. Screensavers run with user privileges when activated and provide
    an execution mechanism triggered by system idle time. Configuration also
    includes screensaver selection, display properties, and activation policies.

  forensic_value: |
    Malware can replace legitimate screensavers with malicious executables for
    persistence that triggers during idle periods. Shows unauthorized screensaver
    modifications that provide execution opportunities when systems are unattended.
    Can indicate sophisticated persistence mechanisms that activate during low-activity
    periods to avoid detection and maintain covert access to compromised systems.

  structure: |
    Desktop settings include SCRNSAVE.EXE (screensaver path), ScreenSaveTimeOut
    (activation time in seconds), ScreenSaverIsSecure (password protection),
    ScreenSaveActive (enabled/disabled), and various screensaver-specific
    configuration parameters stored as REG_SZ values in Control Panel\\Desktop.

  examples:
    - "SCRNSAVE.EXE: C:\\Windows\\System32\\Mystify.scr"
    - "ScreenSaveTimeOut: 900 (15 minutes)"
    - "ScreenSaverIsSecure: 1 (password required to unlock)"
    - "ScreenSaveActive: 1 (screensaver enabled)"
    - "Malicious: SCRNSAVE.EXE: C:\\malware\\backdoor.scr"
    - "Persistence: SCRNSAVE.EXE: powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -File C:\\temp\\payload.ps1"
    - "Hijacked: SCRNSAVE.EXE: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\evil.exe"
    - "ScreenSaveUsePassword: 0 (no password protection)"
