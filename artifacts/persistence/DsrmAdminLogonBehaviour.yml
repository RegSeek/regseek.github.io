title: "DsrmAdminLogonBehaviour Registry Key value"
category: "persistence"

description: "The Dsrm admin account is a non local/logon account. If this registry key is 1 or 2, then that is a garunteed sign of compromise/persistence and domaiance over your forest.

paths:
  - 'HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\DsrmAdminLogonBehavior'

details:
  what: |
    The DsrmAdminLogonBehaviour registry key controls the behavior of the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator account.
    Normally(and I mean almost always) this key is either non exsistent OR it is set to 0. This means the DSRM admin account is not able to 
    logon locally OR logon over the network. If the key is set to 1, it means the DSRM admin account can logon locally, and if it is set to 2,
    it means network authentication is allowed. Not only is this weird, this will never be seen in a normal environment. This is a critical finding 
    and is a strong indicator of compromise or persistence by an attacker who has gained control over the domain.

  forensic_value: |
    This artifact proves that someone had the privlidges to not only edit the registry of the Domain Controller but also that they had the ability to 
    alter your domain controllers keys. The DSRM account is a local administrator, and thus like any local adminsitrator on the domain controller,
    they can preform Dc sync attacks, extract hashes/keys/secrets/dpapi backup master keys, edit domain controller policies, and ultimately; comrpomsie
    the rest of the forest at will. This includes compromise an RODC, and then passing the hash. 

  structure: |
    The DsrmAdminLogonBehaviour key is a DWORD value located in the Windows registry under the path:
    `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DsrmAdminLogonBehavior`.
    It can have the following values:
    - 0: DSRM admin account cannot log on locally or over the network.
    - 1: DSRM admin account can log on locally.
    - 2: DSRM admin account can log on over the network.
