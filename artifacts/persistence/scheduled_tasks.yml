details:
  what: |
    Windows Task Scheduler maintains registry entries for all scheduled tasks,
    including task metadata, execution history, hierarchical organization, and
    trigger information. Tracks both system tasks and user-created automation
    with detailed execution statistics, security contexts, and scheduling patterns.
    Registry data complements XML task definitions stored in the file system.

  forensic_value: |
    Scheduled tasks are a common persistence mechanism for malware and legitimate
    automation. Shows task creation times, execution patterns, authors, and can reveal
    malicious automation, unauthorized access schedules, or privilege escalation attempts.
    Critical for identifying advanced persistent threats (APTs) that use legitimate
    Windows scheduling for persistence and lateral movement.

  structure: |
    Tasks subkey contains binary task metadata including Author, Date, Path, URI,
    Actions, and execution history. Tree subkey maintains hierarchical task organization
    with folder structures. Binary data includes GUID identifiers, security descriptors,
    trigger definitions, and execution statistics in proprietary Microsoft format.

  examples:
    - "Author: Microsoft Corporation"
    - "Path: \\Microsoft\\Windows\\UpdateOrchestrator\\Schedule Scan"
    - "URI: \\MaliciousTask"
    - "Date: 2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
    - "Actions: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe /c malicious_script.bat"
    - "Triggers: Daily at 3:00 AM"
    - "Security Context: SYSTEM"
    - "Last Run: 2024-01-20 03:00:15"
    - "Next Run: 2024-01-21 03:00:00"
    - "Run Count: 47"
