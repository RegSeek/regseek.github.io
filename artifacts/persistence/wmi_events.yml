details:
  what: |
    WMI Event Subscriptions create persistent event-driven triggers that execute
    code when specific system events occur. Consists of Event Filters (WQL queries
    defining trigger conditions), Event Consumers (actions to execute), and
    Filter-to-Consumer Bindings (links between filters and consumers). Provides
    sophisticated, legitimate-seeming persistence that survives reboots and security software.

  forensic_value: |
    Advanced persistence technique used by sophisticated malware, APT groups, and
    advanced persistent threats. Difficult to detect and remove through traditional
    means. Shows evidence of advanced persistence mechanisms that survive system
    reboots, security software removal, and system cleaning. Critical for identifying
    advanced threat actors and sophisticated malware families.

  structure: |
    Registry entries for WMI repository objects including __EventFilter (trigger
    conditions), __EventConsumer (execution actions), and __FilterToConsumerBinding
    (relationships) classes. Binary data contains serialized WMI objects with
    WQL queries, PowerShell payloads, executable paths, and scheduling information.

  examples:
    - "__EventFilter Name: MaliciousProcessMonitor"
    - "Query: SELECT * FROM Win32_ProcessStartTrace WHERE ProcessName='notepad.exe'"
    - "__EventConsumer Type: CommandLineEventConsumer"
    - "CommandLineTemplate: powershell.exe -enc <base64_encoded_payload>"
    - "__FilterToConsumerBinding: Links filter to consumer"
    - "ActiveScriptEventConsumer: VBScript or JScript execution"
    - "ScriptText: CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").Run \"malicious_command\""
    - "LogFileEventConsumer: Write to log file for persistence verification"
    - "SMTPEventConsumer: Email-based command and control"
