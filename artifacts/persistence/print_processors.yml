details:
  what: |
    Windows print system configuration including print processors, print monitors,
    print providers, and printer-specific settings. These DLLs are loaded by the
    spooler service (spoolsv.exe) and provide opportunities for persistent code
    execution with SYSTEM privileges. Controls print job processing, printer
    communication, and network printing functionality through registered DLL components.

  forensic_value: |
    Advanced persistence technique where malware registers malicious DLLs as print
    processors, monitors, or providers. Shows unauthorized print system modifications
    that can provide persistent access with high privileges. Can indicate sophisticated
    attacks targeting the print spooler service for privilege escalation, lateral
    movement, or persistent access to critical systems.

  structure: |
    Print processors and monitors registered with DLL paths, entry points, and
    configuration data. Each entry specifies the DLL location, functionality provided,
    environment (Windows/NT x86/x64), and load order. Print providers handle network
    printing, authentication, and print queue management with specific capabilities.

  examples:
    - "Processors\\winprint\\Driver: C:\\Windows\\System32\\winprint.dll"
    - "Processors\\malicious\\Driver: C:\\malware\\evil_processor.dll"
    - "Monitors\\Standard TCP/IP Port\\Driver: tcpmon.dll"
    - "Monitors\\Backdoor Monitor\\Driver: C:\\temp\\backdoor.dll"
    - "Providers\\LanMan Print Services\\Name: win32spl.dll"
    - "Providers\\Malicious Provider\\Name: C:\\malware\\provider.dll"
    - "PrinterDriverDir: C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers"
    - "Environment: Windows NT x86"
