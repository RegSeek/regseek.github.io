paths:
  - "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders"
  - "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Shell Folders"
  - "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders"
  - "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\User Shell Folders"

details:
  what: |
    Windows defines special folder locations including Desktop, Documents, Startup, system
    directories, and user profile paths. The Startup folder automatically executes programs
    placed in it during user logon, making it a critical persistence location. User Shell
    Folders contain environment variables and can be redirected to alternative locations.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows persistence through Startup folder modification, reveals customized system folder
    locations, indicates folder redirection for data hiding or collection, and can reveal
    attempts to redirect critical folders to attacker-controlled locations. Critical for
    identifying file-based persistence mechanisms and understanding user environment modifications.

  structure: |
    Named values containing folder paths as REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ data with environment
    variable expansion. Common values include Startup folders (user and system-wide), Desktop,
    Personal (Documents), and system directories. Paths can be redirected to unusual locations
    including network shares.

  examples:
    - "Startup: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup"
    - "Common Startup: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup"
    - "Desktop: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop"
    - "Personal: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"
    - "My Pictures: C:\\Users\\user\\Pictures"
    - "Redirected: \\\\server\\share\\startup (network redirection)"
    - "Modified: Startup: C:\\temp\\malicious_startup"
    - "Cache: %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache"

limitations:
  - "Shell folder configuration does NOT prove files were placed in or executed from folders"
  - "Startup folder paths don't indicate programs were launched from startup locations"
  - "Folder redirection settings don't show redirected folders were accessed or used"
  - "Network folder paths don't prove network resources were accessible or utilized"
  - "Modified folder locations don't indicate malicious usage or file operations"
  - "Environment variable paths don't show successful variable expansion or resolution"
  - "Registry entries don't reveal what files exist in configured folders"

    - "Windows Event Logs showing process creation from startup folder programs"
    - "ShellBags showing folder navigation to modified folder locations"

    - "Recent documents showing files accessed from redirected folders"
    - "Network traffic initiated by programs in startup folders"
    - "Registry modifications made by startup folder programs"
    - "File system changes indicating startup folder program activity"
