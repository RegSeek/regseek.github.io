details:
  what: |
    Windows startup sequence configuration encompasses boot execution programs, service group 
    load order, session manager settings, subsystem initialization, and early program loading 
    that occurs during system startup before user logon. Controls critical system component 
    initialization and driver loading sequences for proper system startup.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying system-level persistence mechanisms that load before security 
    software and user-level defenses. Shows boot-time malware installation, startup sequence 
    modifications indicating system compromise, and early-loading persistence techniques used 
    by advanced threats. Essential for detecting rootkits and sophisticated persistence mechanisms.

  structure: |
    Session Manager contains BootExecute (programs run during boot), SubSystems (core system 
    components), ExcludeFromKnownDlls (DLL exclusions), and CriticalDeviceTimeout (hardware 
    initialization timeouts). ServiceGroupOrder defines service loading sequence priorities 
    for proper dependency management during startup operations.

  examples:
    - "BootExecute: autocheck autochk *, C:\\\\malware\\\\startup.exe (Malicious boot program)"
    - "ServiceGroupOrder: System Bus Extender, Base, Network Provider (Loading sequence)"
    - "SubSystems: Windows, Posix (Core subsystem definitions)"
    - "ExcludeFromKnownDlls: malicious.dll (DLL exclusion for hijacking)"
    - "CriticalDeviceTimeout: 10 (10-second hardware initialization timeout)"
    - "KnownDLLs: kernel32, ntdll, user32 (Protected system DLLs)"
    - "Execute: wininit (Windows initialization program)"

limitations:
  - "Startup configuration does NOT prove malicious programs were executed during boot"
  - "Boot execution settings don't indicate successful malware loading or operation"
  - "Service group order modifications may be for legitimate system optimization"
  - "Subsystem configuration changes don't prove unauthorized system modifications"
  - "DLL exclusions may be required for legitimate application compatibility"
  - "Session manager settings don't indicate actual boot sequence execution results"

    - "Process execution logs showing malicious programs launched during startup"
    - "File system artifacts showing malicious executable files in startup locations"
    - "Registry changes showing startup configuration modifications during attack periods"
    - "System logs showing successful boot sequence completion with modified startup programs"

    - "File modifications in startup directories during configuration change periods"
    - "Registry changes in related persistence locations during startup configuration modifications"
