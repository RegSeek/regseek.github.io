description: "Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator account logon configuration - values of 1 or 2 indicate guaranteed compromise and persistence over Active Directory forest"

paths:
  - "HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"

details:
  what: |
    The DsrmAdminLogonBehavior registry key controls the behavior of the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) administrator account.
    Normally (and almost always) this key is either non-existent OR set to 0. This means the DSRM admin account cannot 
    logon locally OR over the network. If the key is set to 1, the DSRM admin account can logon locally, and if set to 2,
    network authentication is allowed. This configuration is extremely rare in normal environments and indicates compromise.

  forensic_value: |
    This artifact proves that someone had the privileges to edit the Domain Controller registry and alter critical security settings. 
    The DSRM account functions as a local administrator, enabling DC sync attacks, hash/key/secret extraction, DPAPI backup master key access, 
    domain controller policy modification, and ultimately complete forest compromise. This includes compromising RODCs and lateral movement.

  structure: |
    The DsrmAdminLogonBehavior key is a DWORD value located at:
    HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\DsrmAdminLogonBehavior
    
    Values:
    - 0: DSRM admin account cannot log on locally or over the network (default/secure)
    - 1: DSRM admin account can log on locally
    - 2: DSRM admin account can log on over the network

  examples:
    - "reg query HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa /v DsrmAdminLogonBehavior"
    - "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa"
    - "DsrmAdminLogonBehavior    REG_DWORD    0x1"

limitations:
  - "Does not indicate when the original compromise occurred"
  - "No known false positives - presence of value 1 or 2 indicates compromise"
  - "Cannot identify who performed the change without additional logging"
