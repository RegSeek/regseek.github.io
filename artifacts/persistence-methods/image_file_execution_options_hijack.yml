details:
  what: |
    Image File Execution Options (IFEO) allows attaching debuggers to processes, modifying
    executable behavior, and controlling process execution parameters. Originally designed
    for debugging and compatibility, malware abuses this mechanism to hijack legitimate
    processes by setting malicious debuggers that run instead of the target application.

  forensic_value: |
    Advanced persistence technique that hijacks legitimate processes through debugger attachment.
    Shows unauthorized debugger attachments, process redirection, and sophisticated evasion
    techniques. Critical for detecting advanced malware persistence, accessibility tool hijacking
    (sticky keys attacks), and process replacement attacks. Can indicate privilege escalation
    attempts and system compromise.

  structure: |
    Executable names as subkeys containing Debugger value pointing to malicious executables,
    GlobalFlag for debugging options, VerifierDlls for application verifier, and various
    debugging parameters. When the hijacked process starts, the debugger runs instead with
    the original process as a parameter.

  examples:
    - "sethc.exe\\Debugger: C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe (Sticky Keys hijack)"
    - "taskmgr.exe\\Debugger: C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "regedit.exe\\Debugger: powershell.exe -enc <base64_payload>"
    - "utilman.exe\\Debugger: C:\\temp\\shell.exe (Utility Manager hijack)"
    - "osk.exe\\Debugger: cmd.exe (On-Screen Keyboard hijack)"
    - "GlobalFlag: 0x200 (Enable heap validation)"
    - "VerifierDlls: malicious_verifier.dll"
    - "DisableHeapLookaside: 1"
    - "PageHeapFlags: 0x03"

limitations:
  - "IFEO debugger settings do NOT prove hijacked processes were actually executed"
  - "Debugger attachments don't indicate successful process redirection occurred"
  - "Registry entries don't show hijacked processes launched their debuggers"
  - "IFEO settings may be overridden by security software or policies"
  - "Process hijacking may fail due to missing debugger files or permission issues"
  - "Accessibility tool hijacking doesn't prove unauthorized access occurred"
  - "Configuration doesn't reveal frequency or success of hijacking attempts"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_hijacking_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing debugger execution instead of target processes"
