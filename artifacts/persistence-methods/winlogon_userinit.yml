paths:
  - "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon"
  - "HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon"
  - "HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify"

details:
  what: |
    Winlogon registry keys control the Windows logon process including which programs run during
    user logon, desktop shell initialization, and system notification handlers. Userinit and
    Shell values specify programs that execute automatically when users log in. Notify subkeys
    register DLLs for logon/logoff event notifications. These mechanisms are fundamental to
    Windows startup process.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical persistence mechanism used by advanced malware and sophisticated attackers. Shows
    unauthorized modifications to the logon process that ensure malware execution on every user
    login. Difficult to detect and highly effective for maintaining access. Can indicate system
    compromise, privilege escalation, and advanced persistent threats. Essential for identifying
    rootkits and advanced malware families.

  structure: |
    Key values include Userinit (programs run during logon initialization), Shell (desktop shell
    program), Notify DLL registrations, and system policies. Values contain comma-separated
    executable paths with parameters. Binary data may include security descriptors and policy
    enforcement mechanisms.

  examples:
    - "Userinit: C:\\Windows\\system32\\userinit.exe,C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "Shell: explorer.exe,C:\\temp\\malicious.exe"
    - "Notify\\malware_notify\\DllName: evil_notify.dll"
    - "AutoAdminLogon: 1 (automatic login enabled)"
    - "DefaultUserName: administrator"
    - "LegalNoticeCaption: System Security Notice"
    - "LegalNoticeText: Authorized use only"
    - "VmApplet: rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL appwiz.cpl"

limitations:
  - "Winlogon configuration does NOT prove modified programs were executed"
  - "Userinit settings don't indicate successful program launch during logon"
  - "Shell modifications don't show desktop environment was compromised"
  - "Notification package entries don't prove DLLs were loaded or executed"
  - "Logon process hijacking may be blocked by security software or policies"
  - "Malicious programs may fail due to missing files, dependencies, or permissions"
  - "Registry entries don't reveal frequency or success of logon process exploitation"
