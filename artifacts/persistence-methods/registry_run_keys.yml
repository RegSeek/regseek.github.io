paths:
  - "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"
  - "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunOnce"
  - "HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"

  - "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunServicesOnce"

details:
  what: |
    Registry locations where Windows automatically executes programs during user logon or system
    startup. HKLM keys run for all users with SYSTEM privileges, HKCU keys run for specific users
    with user privileges. RunOnce keys execute once then delete themselves. RunServices keys exist
    on older Windows versions for service startup.

  forensic_value: |
    Primary persistence mechanism used by malware, backdoors, and legitimate software. Shows what
    programs automatically start with Windows. Critical for identifying unauthorized persistence
    and malware installation. Can reveal privilege escalation attempts and system compromise
    indicators. Essential for incident response triage.

  structure: |
    Value names are arbitrary (often program names), value data contains executable paths with
    optional command line arguments. REG_SZ or REG_EXPAND_SZ format. Can include quotes around
    paths, environment variables, and various command line switches. Entries beginning with
    asterisk (*) are hidden from System Configuration Utility.

  examples:
    - "SecurityHealthSystray: C:\\Windows\\System32\\SecurityHealthSystray.exe"
    - "Malware: C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Roaming\\malware.exe -silent"
    - "UpdateCheck: \"C:\\Program Files\\App\\updater.exe\" /background"
    - "*Persistence: powershell.exe -enc [base64]"
    - "Adobe ARM: %ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Common Files\\Adobe\\ARM\\1.0\\AdobeARM.exe"
    - "Backdoor: cmd.exe /c start /min C:\\temp\\payload.bat"

limitations:
  - "Run key entries do NOT prove programs were successfully executed"
  - "Registry persistence doesn't indicate successful program launch or completion"
  - "Autostart configurations may be blocked by security software or policies"
  - "RunOnce entries don't show if programs executed before key deletion"
  - "Hidden entries (asterisk prefix) don't prove stealth execution occurred"
  - "Registry entries don't reveal frequency, duration, or success of program execution"

correlation:

    - "Process execution logs showing successful program startup from Run keys"
    - "File system artifacts showing program files at specified paths"
    - "Windows Event Logs showing process creation events (Event ID 4688)"
    - "Application event logs showing successful program initialization"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "UserAssist entries showing program execution statistics"
    - "ShimCache entries showing program access attempts"
    - "Registry modifications made by executed programs"
    - "Network traffic initiated by autostart programs"
