details:
  what: |
    Component Object Model (COM) registration database containing Class IDs (CLSIDs),
    Interface IDs (IIDs), Type Library information, and associated DLL/executable paths.
    Controls how applications instantiate and interact with COM objects, services, and
    components. Includes InProcess and OutProcess server registrations.

  forensic_value: |
    COM hijacking is a sophisticated persistence technique where malware replaces legitimate
    COM object paths with malicious DLLs. Shows unauthorized COM object registration, DLL
    path modifications, and potential hijacking attempts. Can indicate rootkit activity,
    advanced persistent threats, and sophisticated malware families using COM for stealth.

  structure: |
    CLSID entries contain InprocServer32 (DLL path), LocalServer32 (EXE path), ProgID
    associations, threading models, and interface definitions. Each CLSID represents a
    unique COM class with specific functionality and implementation. Binary data includes
    type libraries and interface marshaling information.

  examples:
    - "CLSID\\{00021401-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\\InprocServer32: C:\\malware\\evil.dll"
    - "CLSID\\{BCDE0395-E52F-467C-8E3D-C4579291692E}\\LocalServer32: C:\\Windows\\System32\\mmcndmgr.dll"
    - "ProgID: Shell.Application"
    - "ThreadingModel: Apartment"
    - "Version: 1.0"
    - "InprocServer32\\(Default): %SystemRoot%\\system32\\shell32.dll"
    - "AppID: {GUID} (Application ID for DCOM configuration)"
    - "TypeLib: {GUID} (Type Library reference)"
    - "Hijacked CLSID: {GUID}\\InprocServer32: C:\\temp\\backdoor.dll"

limitations:
  - "COM object registration does NOT prove objects were instantiated or executed"
  - "CLSID entries don't indicate successful COM object creation or usage"
  - "DLL paths don't show malicious code was loaded or executed"
  - "Registry hijacking may fail due to application-specific COM binding"
  - "COM object modifications don't prove persistence mechanism was activated"
  - "Threading model settings don't indicate actual COM object behavior"
  - "Interface definitions don't show successful COM interface marshaling"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_hijacking_proof:
    - "Process execution logs showing COM object instantiation and DLL loading"
    - "File system artifacts showing malicious DLL files at hijacked paths"
    - "Application event logs showing COM object creation and interface usage"
    - "Memory dumps showing hijacked COM objects in application address spaces"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Registry modifications made by hijacked COM objects"
    - "Network traffic initiated by malicious COM components"
    - "File system changes indicating COM object activity"
    - "Event logs showing COM+ application activity"
