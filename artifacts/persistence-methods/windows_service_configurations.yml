details:
  what: |
    Windows Services registry contains service configuration including executable paths, 
    startup types, dependencies, security descriptors, service accounts, and failure recovery actions. 
    Controls system service behavior, automatic startup sequences, and service isolation.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for identifying malicious service installation, service hijacking attacks, and unauthorized 
    service modifications used for persistence. Shows evidence of malware services, suspicious service 
    configurations, privilege escalation through service accounts, and service-based backdoors.

  structure: |
    Individual service subkeys contain ImagePath (executable), Start (startup type), Type (service type), 
    ObjectName (service account), DependOnService (dependencies), and ServiceSidType (security identifier type). 
    Svchost configuration manages service hosting for shared processes.

  examples:
    - "Services\\MaliciousService\\ImagePath: C:\\malware\\backdoor.exe"
    - "Services\\Spooler\\Start: 2 (Automatic startup)"
    - "Services\\BITS\\Type: 32 (Win32 service, share process)"
    - "Services\\TrustedInstaller\\ObjectName: NT SERVICE\\TrustedInstaller"
    - "Services\\Themes\\DependOnService: RpcSs (RPC dependency)"
    - "Svchost\\netsvcs: BITS,Themes,Schedule,ProfSvc (Service group)"
    - "Services\\BackdoorSvc\\FailureActions: [Binary recovery settings]"
    - "Services\\SuspiciousSvc\\ServiceSidType: 1 (Unrestricted service SID)"

limitations:
  - "Service registration does NOT prove service was started or executed"
  - "Disabled services (Start=4) will not execute automatically"
  - "Service configuration may be created by installers without immediate activation"
  - "Manual start services (Start=3) require explicit user or system initiation"
  - "Service dependencies may prevent service from starting even if configured"
  - "Administrative privileges are required to install services"
  - "Service accounts may lack necessary permissions for execution"
  - "Service failure actions may not trigger if dependencies fail"
