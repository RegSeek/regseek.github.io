details:
  what: |
    Chrome and Edge store configuration data in the registry including extension information,
    security policies, homepage settings, search preferences, and profile configurations.
    Enterprise policies control browser behavior and security restrictions.

  forensic_value: |
    Shows evidence of malicious extensions, homepage hijacking, policy bypasses, and 
    browser-based attacks. Critical for detecting browser malware, data exfiltration 
    through extensions, and unauthorized configuration changes.

  structure: |
    Hierarchical registry structure with JSON-formatted values for complex settings,
    REG_DWORD for boolean options, and REG_SZ for text preferences. Separate branches
    for user preferences and machine-wide policies.

  examples:
    - "HomepageLocation: http://malicious-site.com"
    - "Extensions\\Installed: [{\"extension_id\": \"malicious_extension\"}]"
    - "DefaultSearchProviderSearchURL: http://evil-search.com/search?q={searchTerms}"
    - "Policies\\URLBlocklist: [\"*.security-site.com\"]"
    - "PreferenceMACs: [integrity verification values]"
    - "Profile Path: C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Google\\\\Chrome\\\\User Data"
    - "BookmarkBarEnabled: 1 (Bookmark bar visibility)"

limitations:
  - "Registry data shows configuration only, NOT actual browsing behavior or usage"
  - "Extension presence does NOT prove active usage or malicious activity"
  - "Homepage/search settings do NOT prove user visited those sites"
  - "Policy settings do NOT prove actual enforcement or user compliance"
  - "Configuration changes do NOT prove browser was actively used"
  - "Malicious extensions can hide from registry detection"
  - "Policy enforcement may be bypassed by users or malware"
  - "Registry entries do NOT show downloaded files or browsing history"
