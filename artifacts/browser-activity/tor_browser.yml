details:
  what: |
    Tor Browser registry entries store installation paths, security configurations,
    and file associations. Contains privacy settings, security levels, and proxy
    configurations for anonymous browsing.

  forensic_value: |
    Indicates privacy-conscious behavior and potential attempts to evade monitoring.
    Shows evidence of anonymity tool usage, dark web access capabilities, and
    security-aware browsing patterns.

  structure: |
    Tor Browser configuration includes proxy settings, security level preferences,
    bridge configurations, and anonymity options. Privacy settings track JavaScript
    restrictions, plugin blocking, and anti-fingerprinting measures for comprehensive
    privacy-focused browsing behavior analysis and security-conscious user profiling.
