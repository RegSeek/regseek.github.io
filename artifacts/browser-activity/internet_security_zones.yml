details:
  what: |
    Internet Explorer security zones control website trust levels and security policies.
    Manages Internet, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted Sites zones with
    ActiveX control permissions, script execution restrictions, and download behaviors.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating browser-based attacks and security policy bypasses.
    Shows evidence of trusted site modifications that facilitate attacks, security
    zone changes that weaken defenses, and policy violations.

  structure: |
    Security zones numbered 0-4 (My Computer, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, Internet, Restricted)
    with detailed security settings as REG_DWORD values. ZoneMap contains site-to-zone assignments.
    Policy enforcement controls enterprise-wide browser security through Group Policy.

  examples:
    - "Zones\\1\\1001: 3 (Local Intranet - Prompt for ActiveX download)"
    - "Zones\\2\\1200: 0 (Trusted Sites - Enable ActiveX controls)"
    - "Zones\\3\\1400: 1 (Internet - Disable active scripting)"
    - "Zones\\4\\1001: 3 (Restricted - Disable ActiveX completely)"
    - "ZoneMap\\Domains\\malicious-site.com: 4 (Restricted zone assignment)"
    - "ZoneMap\\Domains\\intranet.company.com: 1 (Local Intranet zone)"
    - "Policies\\DisableSecuritySettingsCheck: 1 (Security warnings disabled)"
    - "ProtectedMode\\Enabled: 0 (Protected Mode disabled - security risk)"

limitations:
  - "Configuration shows security settings only, not actual exploitation attempts"
  - "Trusted site assignments don't prove malicious activity occurred"
  - "Zone modifications may be legitimate administrative changes"
  - "Settings may be overridden by Group Policy or user actions"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "Browser history showing visits to modified trusted sites"
    - "Network traffic logs showing malicious communication"
    - "ActiveX control execution logs or crash dumps"
    - "Process execution showing exploitation artifacts"
  
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Timeline analysis of when zone settings were changed"
    - "User activity correlating with security modifications"
    - "Other browser security bypasses or malware"
