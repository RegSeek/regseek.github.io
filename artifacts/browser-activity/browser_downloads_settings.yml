details:
  what: |
    Browser download configuration controls default download locations, security restrictions,
    file type handling, and automatic download behavior. Manages download folder settings,
    security zone restrictions, and malware protection settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating malware delivery and unauthorized downloads. Shows evidence
    of download folder modifications that could facilitate malware execution, security
    bypasses, and attempts to weaken browser defenses for malware distribution.

  structure: |
    Download configuration includes Download Directory (default save location), security
    settings for different zones, file type associations, and download notification preferences.
    Security restrictions control download behavior with policy enforcement.

  examples:
    - "Download Directory: C:\\Users\\user\\Downloads (Standard download location)"
    - "Download Directory: C:\\Temp\\Malware (Suspicious download location)"
    - "DisableFirstRunCustomize: 1 (Skip security setup wizard)"
    - "Check_Associations: no (Disable file association checking)"
    - "Safety Warning Level: Low (Reduced download security warnings)"
    - "NoSelectDownloadDir: 1 (Prevent download folder selection)"
    - "RestrictFileDownload: 0 (Allow all file downloads)"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows download configuration only, not actual downloaded files"
  - "Download directory setting doesn't prove files were downloaded there"
  - "Security settings may be overridden by Group Policy"
  - "Configuration changes don't indicate when downloads occurred"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_conclusions:
    - "Downloaded files in specified directories"
    - "Browser history showing download URLs"
    - "File system timestamps matching download activity"
    - "Network logs showing file downloads"

    - "Timeline analysis of configuration changes"
