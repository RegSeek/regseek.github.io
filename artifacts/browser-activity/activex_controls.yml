details:
  what: |
    ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects that provide interactive functionality in Internet Explorer.
    Registry manages control registration, security settings, kill bits for blocking dangerous
    controls, and compatibility flags.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating browser-based attacks and malicious ActiveX installations.
    Shows evidence of dangerous controls, exploitation attempts, and security policy
    modifications that weaken browser defenses.

  structure: |
    ActiveX Compatibility contains CLSID entries with Compatibility Flags and kill bits.
    Distribution Units track downloaded controls. Kill bits are REG_DWORD values that
    prevent specific controls from running.

  examples:
    - "ActiveX Compatibility\\{CLSID}\\Compatibility Flags: 0x00000400 (Kill bit - blocked)"
    - "ActiveX Compatibility\\{6BF52A52-394A-11d3-B153-00C04F79FAA6}: Windows Media Player"
    - "Distribution Units\\{D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000}: Adobe Flash Player"
    - "CLSID\\{CLSID}\\InprocServer32: C:\\malware\\malicious_control.dll"
    - "Kill Bit: Compatibility Flags: 0x00000400 (ActiveX control disabled for security)"
    - "CodeBase: http://malicious-site.com/exploit.cab"

limitations:
  - "Registry shows registered controls only, not actual execution or exploitation"
  - "Kill bits show administrative blocking, not attempted attacks"
  - "Legitimate software may register ActiveX controls for valid purposes"
  - "Controls can be registered but never used by applications"
