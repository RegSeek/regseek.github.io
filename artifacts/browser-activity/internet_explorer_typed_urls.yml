details:
  what: |
    Internet Explorer maintains a record of URLs that users manually type in the address bar
    for autocomplete functionality. Stores chronological order of manual URL entry with
    corresponding timestamps for each typed address.

  forensic_value: |
    Extremely valuable for investigating intentional website visits and manual navigation
    to suspicious sites. Shows deliberate attempts to access specific websites, command
    and control domains manually entered, and evidence of users actively seeking specific
    content. Critical for establishing intent in cybercrime investigations.

  structure: |
    Sequential value names (url1, url2, url3, etc.) containing full URLs as REG_SZ data.
    TypedURLsTime contains corresponding binary FILETIME timestamps for each URL entry.
    Most recent entries receive higher sequential numbers, maintaining chronological order.

  examples:
    - "url1: https://www.google.com (Common search engine access)"
    - "url2: https://malicious-domain.com (Suspicious manual navigation)"
    - "url3: http://192.168.1.100:8080 (Direct IP address with non-standard port)"
    - "url4: ftp://internal-server.company.com (Internal FTP server access)"
    - "url5: https://darkweb-marketplace.onion (Tor hidden service access)"
    - "url6: https://sensitive-competitor-site.com (Potential corporate espionage)"
    - "TypedURLsTime: Binary FILETIME timestamps corresponding to each URL"
