details:
  what: |
    Windows Run dialog maintains a Most Recently Used (MRU) list of commands executed through
    the Run interface (Win+R keyboard shortcut). Tracks command execution history including
    system utilities, administrative tools, file paths, network locations, and custom commands
    entered by users for quick access to Windows functionality and programs.

  forensic_value: |
    Extremely valuable for detecting administrative tool usage, malicious command execution,
    system reconnaissance activities, and attempts to access restricted utilities. Shows
    evidence of command-line tool usage, administrative access attempts, network resource
    enumeration, and potential privilege escalation activities. Critical for understanding
    user intent and technical knowledge level during investigations.

  structure: |
    Sequential lettered values (a, b, c, etc.) containing executed commands as REG_SZ data.
    MRUList value shows execution chronology with most recent commands listed first using
    letter indicators. Commands include full paths, parameters, network locations, and
    built-in Windows utilities with complete command syntax preservation.

  examples:
    - "a: cmd (Command Prompt execution)"
    - "b: regedit (Registry Editor access)"
    - "c: gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor)"
    - "d: services.msc (Services management console)"
    - "e: \\\\192.168.1.100\\admin$ (Network administrative share)"
    - "f: powershell -enc [base64] (PowerShell encoded command)"
    - "g: C:\\temp\\malware.exe (Suspicious executable execution)"
    - "MRUList: gfedcba (chronological order, newest first)"
