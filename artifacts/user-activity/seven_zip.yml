details:
  what: |
    7-Zip archive utility stores configuration including compression settings, file
    associations, context menu integration, and archive handling preferences.
    Registry tracks archive creation/extraction activity, compression algorithms,
    password usage, and interface customizations for comprehensive archive tool
    usage analysis and file compression behavior tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data packaging for exfiltration, evidence destruction
    through compression, password-protected archive creation, and file transfer
    preparation. Shows evidence of archive manipulation, compression activities,
    and can indicate data theft preparation, evidence concealment, or file
    organization for unauthorized distribution through compressed archive usage.

  structure: |
    7-Zip configuration includes compression level preferences, archive format
    settings, password protection usage, context menu integration, and file
    association data. Archive history shows processed files, compression ratios,
    and extraction activities for comprehensive archive tool behavior analysis.

  examples:
    - "InstallPath: C:\\Program Files\\7-Zip"
    - "CompressionLevel: 5 (Normal compression)"
    - "ArchiveFormat: 7z (Default archive format)"
    - "ContextMenu: 1 (Explorer context menu integration)"
    - "FileAssociation: .7z -> 7-Zip File Manager"
    - "FileAssociation: .rar -> 7-Zip File Manager"
    - "SolidArchive: 1 (Solid compression enabled)"
    - "EncryptionMethod: AES-256 (Archive encryption method)"
