details:
  what: |
    WinRAR archive utility stores configuration including recent archive files,
    extraction paths, compression settings, and file association preferences.
    Registry tracks archive creation/extraction activity, password usage patterns,
    temporary file locations, and compression preferences for comprehensive
    archive tool usage analysis and file handling behavior tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data packaging for exfiltration, evidence destruction
    through compression, password-protected archive usage, and file transfer
    preparation. Shows evidence of archive creation/extraction activity, reveals
    potentially suspicious file packaging, and can indicate data theft preparation
    or evidence concealment through compressed archives.

  structure: |
    WinRAR configuration includes recent archive lists, default extraction paths,
    compression levels, password settings, and file association data. Archive
    history shows processed files, extraction locations, and access patterns
    for comprehensive archive tool behavior analysis and data handling tracking.

  examples:
    - "ArcHistory: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\sensitive_data.rar"
    - "ArcHistory: C:\\Temp\\exfiltration_package.zip"
    - "ExtrPath: C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\extracted\\"
    - "Compression: 3 (Normal compression level)"
    - "SavePaths: 1 (Save extraction paths)"
    - "Password: (Encrypted password usage indicator)"
    - "TempPath: C:\\Temp\\WinRAR\\ (Temporary extraction location)"
