details:
  what: |
    Windows gaming and entertainment infrastructure encompasses Xbox Live integration, Game Bar
    functionality, game recording capabilities, gaming performance optimization, graphics settings,
    and entertainment application preferences. Controls game mode behavior, screen recording,
    social gaming features, and hardware acceleration for enhanced gaming experience and
    multimedia consumption.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for behavioral analysis, user profiling, and timeline reconstruction. Gaming
    activity patterns can establish user presence, reveal social connections through gaming
    platforms, and indicate system usage during specific timeframes. Game recordings and
    screenshots may contain inadvertent evidence, while gaming-related network activity
    can reveal communication patterns and social engineering opportunities.

  structure: |
    Game Bar configuration includes recording settings, hotkey assignments, overlay preferences,
    and privacy controls. GameDVR manages game capture functionality, storage locations, and
    recording quality settings. Xbox integration contains account information, social features,
    and cloud gaming preferences. Graphics drivers control hardware acceleration and gaming optimizations.
