details:
  what: |
    Windows print subsystem maintains comprehensive printer configurations including installed
    printers, network printer connections, print settings, driver information, user-specific
    printer preferences, print processor configurations, and evidence of print job activity.
    Manages local and network printer access, document printing patterns, and print spooler
    service behavior for complete printing infrastructure management.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating data exfiltration through physical document printing, intellectual
    property theft, and unauthorized document access. Shows what documents were printed, which
    printers were accessed, network printer usage patterns, and potential evidence of sensitive
    information being transferred to hard copy format. Essential for insider threat investigations
    involving document theft and corporate espionage through print channels.

  structure: |
    Printer configurations stored as printer name subkeys containing driver information, port
    assignments, device settings, security descriptors, and print processor details. User
    settings include default printer selections, device modes for specific print configurations,
    and printer-specific preferences. Network printer connections show authentication and
    access patterns with connection timestamps and usage statistics.
