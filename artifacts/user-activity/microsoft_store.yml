details:
  what: |
    Microsoft Store and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application ecosystem including installed
    app packages, package registrations, Store configuration settings, app container security
    configurations, and sideloading permissions. Manages modern Windows application deployment,
    updates, licensing, and sandboxed execution environment for enhanced security and user experience.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for analyzing modern app usage patterns, identifying sideloaded applications that
    bypass Store security mechanisms, detecting unauthorized app installations, and investigating
    app-based data exfiltration or malicious activities. Shows evidence of enterprise app deployments,
    developer mode enabling, and potential security bypasses through sideloading or app container
    escape techniques used by sophisticated attackers.

  structure: |
    Package registration data organized by package full names including publisher information,
    installation paths, security descriptors, and app capabilities. Store configuration includes
    installation policies, update settings, and purchase restrictions. AppX deployment information
    contains package metadata, installation locations, and app container security configurations.

    - "PackageMoniker: CompanyName.SuspiciousApp_1.0.0.0_x64__1234567890abc (Sideloaded app)"
    - "DeveloperModeEnabled: 1 (Developer mode active - allows sideloading)"
