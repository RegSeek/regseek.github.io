details:
  what: |
    Windows generates and caches thumbnail images for photos, videos, documents, and other files
    to improve Explorer performance and user experience. Registry settings control thumbnail
    generation behavior, cache size limits, quality settings, network file thumbnails, and
    preview pane functionality for enhanced file browsing.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigations involving inappropriate content, intellectual property theft, or
    data exfiltration. Even when original files are deleted, thumbnail images may persist in
    cache files, providing visual evidence of viewed content. Registry settings reveal if
    thumbnails were disabled to hide activity or if specialized thumbnail configurations
    indicate specific user behaviors or security-conscious modifications.

  structure: |
    Configuration settings include DisableThumbnailCache (thumbnail generation), DisableThumbsDBOnNetworkFolders
    (network thumbnails), ThumbnailSize (image dimensions), ShowPreviewPane (preview visibility),
    ThumbnailQuality (compression settings), and AlwaysShowIcons (disable thumbnails completely).
    Values stored as REG_DWORD with various numerical settings.

  examples:
    - "DisableThumbnailCache: 1 (Thumbnail generation disabled)"
    - "DisableThumbsDBOnNetworkFolders: 1 (No network thumbnails)"
    - "ThumbnailSize: 256 (Large thumbnail dimensions)"
    - "ShowPreviewPane: 0 (Preview pane hidden)"
    - "ThumbnailQuality: 90 (High quality compression)"
    - "AlwaysShowIcons: 1 (Force generic icons instead of thumbnails)"
    - "NoThumbnailCache: 1 (Prevent thumbnail cache creation)"
