details:
  what: |
    Windows Search service maintains comprehensive configuration for file indexing, search behavior,
    crawl scope management, and search preferences. Controls which files and locations are searchable,
    file type filters, search result preferences, privacy settings, and indexing service behavior
    for both local and network resources.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding user search patterns, data access intentions, and information-seeking
    behavior. Shows what locations were indexed for search capabilities, reveals search preferences
    that might indicate user intent to hide or find specific data types, and provides insights
    into file access patterns through search functionality. Configuration changes may indicate
    attempts to hide data from search or expand search capabilities for data discovery.

  structure: |
    Search configuration includes indexed location rules (CrawlScopeManager), file type filters,
    search preferences, service status, and privacy settings. CrawlScopeManager contains inclusion
    and exclusion rules with scope definitions for local drives, network paths, and specific
    folders. Preferences control search behavior, history, and result display options.

  examples:
    - "IndexedLocations: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents"
    - "ExcludedPaths: C:\\Windows\\Temp, C:\\Program Files"
    - "EnableWebSearchInHistory: 1 (Web search enabled)"
    - "SearchHistory: 1 (Search history tracking enabled)"
    - "PrivacyMode: 0 (Privacy mode disabled)"
    - "IndexerState: 2 (Indexing service running)"
    - "CrawlIncludePatterns: *.pdf, *.docx, *.xlsx"
    - "NetworkIndexing: 0 (Network locations excluded from indexing)"
