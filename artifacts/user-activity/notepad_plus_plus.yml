    Notepad++ text editor stores configuration including recent file lists, session
    data, plugin configurations, and editing preferences. Registry tracks document
    access patterns, programming language usage, find/replace history, and workspace
    settings for comprehensive text editing activity analysis and development
    work pattern tracking in programming and text manipulation activities.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating source code access, configuration file modifications,
    script development, and text-based evidence manipulation. Shows evidence of
    programming activity, configuration file editing, document modification patterns,
    and can reveal development work, system administration activities, or evidence
    of script-based attacks and system configuration changes.

  structure: |
    Notepad++ configuration includes recent file paths, session restoration data,
    language syntax settings, plugin configurations, and find/replace history.
    File history shows accessed documents, editing sessions, and workspace
    configurations for comprehensive text editing behavior analysis.
