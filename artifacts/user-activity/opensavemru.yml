details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks files and folders accessed through standard Open and Save dialog boxes
    used by most Windows applications. Maintains separate lists organized by file extension
    and includes folder navigation history within dialogs. Captures user file interaction
    patterns across applications, showing what files were opened, saved, or accessed through
    standard Windows file dialogs regardless of the specific application used.

  forensic_value: |
    Reveals comprehensive user file access patterns, document locations, network share usage, 
    and specific files opened for editing, viewing, or saving. Shows evidence of data access,
    document tampering, unauthorized file operations, and can indicate data staging for 
    exfiltration. Critical for proving user interaction with specific files and understanding
    work patterns across multiple applications.

  structure: |
    Organized by file extensions (*.*, txt, pdf, docx, etc.) with MRUListEx showing
    access order within each category. Binary data contains full file paths, folder locations,
    and shell item lists. OpenSavePidlMRU uses PIDL format for richer location data including
    network paths, special folders, and metadata. Each extension maintains separate access history.

  examples:
    - "Extension: *.*\\0: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents\\confidential.pdf"
    - "Extension: txt\\1: C:\\Temp\\passwords.txt"
    - "Extension: xlsx\\2: \\\\server\\finance\\budget2024.xlsx"
    - "Extension: exe\\0: D:\\USB\\suspicious_tool.exe"
    - "Extension: zip\\1: C:\\Downloads\\data_archive.zip"
    - "MRUListEx: 2,1,0 (most recent order within extension)"
    - "Network path: \\\\192.168.1.100\\shared\\sensitive_data.docx"
    - "Special folder: Desktop\\document.pdf"
