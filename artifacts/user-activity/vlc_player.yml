  what: |
    VLC Media Player stores configuration including recent media files, playlists,
    playback preferences, subtitle settings, and file associations. Registry tracks
    media consumption patterns, network streaming usage, codec preferences, and
    interface customizations for comprehensive media player behavior analysis
    and user media consumption activity tracking.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating media consumption patterns, potential copyright
    violations, network streaming activity, and evidence of specific media file
    access. Shows evidence of video/audio content consumption, network media
    streaming, and can reveal timeline information about user media activities.
    Useful for behavioral analysis and establishing user presence/activity patterns.

  structure: |
    VLC configuration includes recent media lists, interface preferences, codec
    settings, network stream URLs, subtitle configurations, and file association
    data. Recent items show media file paths, network streams, and access timestamps
    for comprehensive media consumption analysis and user behavior profiling.
