details:
  what: |
    Windows tracks application-specific Most Recently Used (MRU) items including file dialog
    sizing preferences, default folder locations, stream operations, and automated destination
    management. Provides granular tracking of user interaction patterns with file dialogs,
    application preferences, and document access behaviors across different software applications
    and file operation contexts.

  forensic_value: |
    Provides detailed user interaction patterns with applications and file systems, reveals
    preferred locations for file operations across different applications, shows evidence of
    document manipulation activities, and indicates user workflow patterns. Critical for
    understanding user behavior, establishing application usage timelines, and correlating
    file access activities with specific applications and user intentions.

  structure: |
    CIDSizeMRU stores dialog box sizing preferences organized by application executable names.
    FirstFolder maintains default folder locations for file dialogs by file type context.
    StreamMRU contains data stream access patterns with binary PIDL (Pointer to Item IDentifier List)
    data representing folder locations and navigation history in specialized data formats.

  examples:
    - "CIDSizeMRU\\notepad.exe: Dialog size 800x600 (Notepad file dialog preferences)"
    - "CIDSizeMRU\\winword.exe: Word document dialog sizing information"
    - "FirstFolder\\*.txt: C:\\Users\\user\\Documents (Default text file location)"
    - "FirstFolder\\*.pdf: C:\\Downloads (Default PDF file location)"
    - "StreamMRU\\0: Binary PIDL data for recent stream operations"
    - "LastVisitedMRU\\exe files: C:\\Tools\\Utilities (Executable file access location)"
    - "MRUListEx: 2,1,0 (Access order - most recent first)"
