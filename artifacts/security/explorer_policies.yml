details:
  what: |
    Windows Explorer policy framework controls user interface restrictions, folder access permissions,
    desktop limitations, shell behavior modifications, and administrative security controls. Manages
    Group Policy enforcement for Explorer functionality, file system access restrictions, and
    user interface element visibility. Provides comprehensive control over user interaction
    capabilities with the Windows shell and file system navigation.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating administrative security bypass attempts, policy modifications that
    facilitate unauthorized access, and evidence of system restrictions being circumvented. Shows
    if attackers disabled security controls to hide malicious activity, modified user interface
    restrictions to access administrative tools, or bypassed folder access limitations to reach
    sensitive data. Essential for understanding security posture during incidents.

  structure: |
    Policy values stored as REG_DWORD entries controlling specific Explorer restrictions and
    behaviors. Common policies include NoRun (disable Run dialog), NoControlPanel (hide Control Panel),
    NoDesktop (disable desktop), NoFileMenu (disable File menu), and folder access restrictions.
    Advanced settings control file system behavior, hidden file visibility, and extension display.

  examples:
    - "NoRun: 1 (Run dialog disabled - restricts command execution)"
    - "NoControlPanel: 1 (Control Panel access hidden - limits system configuration)"
    - "NoDesktop: 1 (Desktop functionality disabled - severe restriction)"
    - "NoFileMenu: 1 (File menu disabled in Explorer - limits file operations)"
    - "Hidden: 2 (Show hidden files and folders - security setting modified)"
    - "HideFileExt: 0 (Show file extensions - security enhancement)"
    - "NoFolderOptions: 1 (Folder Options access disabled)"
    - "RestrictRun: 1 (Restrict specific executable execution)"
