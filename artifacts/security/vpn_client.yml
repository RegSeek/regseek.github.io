    kill switch configurations for comprehensive VPN usage analysis and privacy
    service behavior tracking in security-conscious networking environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating privacy-seeking behavior, geographic location
    obfuscation, potential evasion techniques, and privacy service usage. Shows
    evidence of VPN connectivity, server preferences, privacy tool adoption,
    and can indicate attempts to hide network traffic, evade geographic restrictions,
    or maintain anonymity in network communications and online activities.

  structure: |
    VPN client configuration includes server endpoints, authentication methods,
    connection protocols, kill switch settings, and privacy preferences. Subscription
    data tracks account information, service features, and usage patterns for
    comprehensive VPN service behavior analysis and privacy-focused networking assessment.
