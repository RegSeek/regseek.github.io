details:
  what: |
    Windows Hello biometric authentication system encompasses fingerprint reader configuration,
    facial recognition settings, iris scanning support, PIN complexity requirements, and
    enterprise policy enforcement. Controls biometric enrollment processes, authentication
    methods, device trust requirements, and passwordless authentication capabilities
    for enhanced security and user convenience in modern Windows environments.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for understanding authentication mechanisms that may affect system access,
    reveals biometric enrollment indicating user presence and device usage patterns,
    shows enterprise authentication policies, and indicates sophisticated security
    configurations. May reveal attempts to bypass biometric authentication or
    unauthorized enrollment attempts that could indicate unauthorized physical access.

  structure: |
    WinBio configuration includes biometric service settings, enrolled user information,
    sensor configuration, and policy enforcement. PassportForWork contains PIN policies,
    biometric requirements, and enterprise authentication settings. DeviceLock manages
    screen lock behavior, authentication timeouts, and security requirements.
