details:
  what: |
    Windows manages application permissions for camera and microphone access through the
    Capability Access Manager. Registry stores consent decisions, application-specific
    permissions, system-wide privacy settings, and usage tracking for audio/video
    recording capabilities. Controls which applications can access sensitive hardware
    devices and maintains audit trails of permission grants and denials.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privacy violations, unauthorized surveillance, and potential
    malware with recording capabilities. Shows evidence of applications attempting to
    access camera/microphone, reveals privacy setting modifications that could indicate
    malicious activity, and provides timeline of when sensitive permissions were granted
    or denied. Essential for detecting spyware, unauthorized recording, and privacy breaches.

  structure: |
    ConsentStore entries include Value (Allow/Deny), LastUsedTimeStart/LastUsedTimeStop
    timestamps as FILETIME, and application-specific permission entries with package
    family names for UWP apps and executable paths for desktop applications. Global
    settings control system-wide camera/microphone access policies.

  examples:
    - "microphone\\Value: Allow (System-wide microphone access enabled)"
    - "webcam\\Value: Deny (System-wide camera access disabled)"
    - "microphone\\Microsoft.SkypeApp_kzf8qxf38zg5c\\Value: Allow (Skype microphone permission)"
    - "webcam\\C:\\Program Files\\Zoom\\bin\\Zoom.exe\\Value: Allow (Zoom camera permission)"
    - "LastUsedTimeStart: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: Last camera access)"
    - "LastUsedTimeStop: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: Camera access ended)"
