details:
  what: |
    Credential Providers extend Windows authentication infrastructure with custom logon methods,
    smart card integration, biometric authentication, multi-factor authentication, and enterprise
    single sign-on solutions. Registry manages provider registration, authentication filters,
    Pre-Logon Access Provider (PLAP) configuration, and credential enumeration settings for
    comprehensive authentication ecosystem management and security enhancement.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for detecting unauthorized authentication modifications, malicious credential
    harvesting tools, and sophisticated attack techniques targeting authentication infrastructure.
    Shows evidence of credential provider abuse for password interception, authentication bypass
    attempts, and unauthorized access to authentication systems. Essential for analyzing advanced
    persistent threats that target authentication mechanisms and credential theft operations.

  structure: |
    Credential Providers registry contains CLSID-based entries referencing COM objects that
    implement authentication interfaces. Each provider includes DLL paths, capability flags,
    trust levels, and configuration parameters. Provider Filters control authentication flow,
    while PLAP Providers manage pre-logon network connectivity for domain authentication scenarios.
