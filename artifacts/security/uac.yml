details:
  what: |
    User Account Control (UAC) manages privilege elevation requests and administrative
    approval mode for standard users and administrators. Registry controls prompt
    behavior, elevation policies, secure desktop usage, and administrative token
    filtering to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation and enhance system
    security through controlled administrative access and user consent requirements.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privilege escalation attempts, UAC bypass techniques,
    and unauthorized administrative access. Shows evidence of UAC policy modifications
    that could weaken security, reveals attempts to disable security prompts, and
    indicates sophisticated attacks targeting Windows privilege control mechanisms.
    Essential for detecting UAC bypass malware and administrative rights abuse.

  structure: |
    UAC configuration includes EnableLUA (UAC enabled/disabled), ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
    (admin prompt behavior), ConsentPromptBehaviorUser (standard user prompts),
    PromptOnSecureDesktop (secure desktop usage), and EnableInstallerDetection
    (installer privilege detection) for comprehensive privilege control analysis.

  examples:
    - "EnableLUA: 1 (UAC enabled)"
    - "EnableLUA: 0 (UAC disabled - security risk)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: 2 (Prompt for consent on secure desktop)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin: 0 (Elevate without prompting - dangerous)"
    - "ConsentPromptBehaviorUser: 3 (Prompt for credentials)"
    - "PromptOnSecureDesktop: 1 (Use secure desktop for prompts)"
    - "EnableInstallerDetection: 1 (Detect installation programs)"
