details:
  what: |
    Windows capability access manager controls application permissions for sensitive device
    resources including camera, microphone, location services, contacts, calendar, messaging,
    and other privacy-sensitive capabilities. Manages both global permission settings and
    per-application granular access controls for comprehensive privacy protection and
    security enforcement across Modern Windows applications.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating privacy violations, unauthorized surveillance, data exfiltration
    through device sensors, and malicious application behavior. Shows which applications
    have access to sensitive resources like cameras and microphones, reveals potential
    surveillance capabilities, and indicates privacy-conscious user behavior or attempts
    to hide malicious access to device capabilities through permission manipulation.

  structure: |
    ConsentStore organizes permissions by capability type (camera, microphone, location, etc.)
    with global and per-application settings. DeviceAccess controls system-wide capability
    enablement, Privacy settings manage user-level privacy preferences, and AppPrivacy
    policies enforce enterprise privacy controls and application access restrictions.

  examples:
    - "ConsentStore\\\\webcam\\\\Value: Allow (Global camera access enabled)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\microphone\\\\Value: Deny (Global microphone access disabled)"
    - "Microsoft.Camera_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\\\Value: Allow (Camera app access granted)"
    - "Skype_kzf8qxf38zg5c\\\\Value: Allow (Skype microphone and camera access)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\location\\\\Value: Deny (Location services disabled globally)"
    - "ConsentStore\\\\contacts\\\\Value: Allow (Contact access permitted)"
    - "Global\\\\{E5323777-F976-4f5b-9B55-B94699C46E44}\\\\Value: Deny (Location disabled)"
    - "AppPrivacy\\\\LetAppsAccessCamera: 2 (Force deny camera access policy)"
