details:
  what: |
    Windows stores information about mapped network drives, shared folder connections, UNC path access history, 
    and persistent drive mappings. Maintains both active drive mappings and historical connection data including 
    server names, share paths, authentication credentials, and connection persistence settings.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating lateral movement, data exfiltration routes, unauthorized network access, and 
    corporate espionage through network shares. Shows evidence of file server access, shared resource usage patterns, 
    and potential data staging locations on network drives.

  structure: |
    Network registry key contains drive letters as subkeys with RemotePath (UNC path), ProviderName (network provider), 
    UserName (authentication context), and ConnectionType (persistent/temporary). Map Network Drive MRU stores 
    recently accessed UNC paths in chronological order.

  examples:
    - "Z:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\fileserver.domain.com\\\\shared (Corporate file server)"
    - "Y:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\192.168.1.100\\\\admin$ (Administrative share access)"
    - "X:\\\\RemotePath: \\\\\\\\suspicious-server\\\\confidential (Potential unauthorized access)"
    - "ProviderName: Microsoft Windows Network (Standard SMB/CIFS provider)"
    - "UserName: DOMAIN\\\\username (Authentication context for connection)"
    - "ConnectionType: 1 (Persistent connection - reconnects on logon)"
    - "MRU: \\\\\\\\server\\\\finance (Recently accessed financial share)"

limitations:
  - "Mapped drive configuration does NOT prove files were accessed or transferred"
  - "Network drive mappings don't indicate successful authentication to remote servers"
  - "MRU entries don't show what files were accessed on network shares"
  - "Persistent connections don't prove drives were actively used after mapping"
  - "UNC path history doesn't indicate successful connection establishment"
  - "Administrative share mappings may be legitimate system administration"
  - "Drive letter assignments don't show frequency or duration of usage"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "SMB/CIFS protocol logs showing actual file server connections and authentication"
    - "File system access logs showing files opened or transferred on network drives"
    - "Event logs showing successful network drive connections and logon sessions"
    - "Network traffic captures showing file sharing protocol communication"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Recent documents showing files accessed from mapped network locations"
    - "Process execution logs showing applications accessing network drives"
    - "File modification timestamps on network shares correlating with user activity"
