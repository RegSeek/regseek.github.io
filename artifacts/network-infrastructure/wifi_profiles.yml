details:
  what: |
    Windows WiFi network profile information including SSID names, security configurations,
    connection properties, network categories, and encrypted credentials for automatic
    reconnection. Network signatures track connection history and first/last connection times.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for establishing user location patterns, travel history, and potential access points
    visited by suspects. WiFi profiles reveal geographic movement, lifestyle patterns, and
    association with specific locations or organizations. Can indicate compromise through rogue
    access points or reveal investigative leads about suspect activities.

  structure: |
    Network profiles stored with GUIDs as registry keys containing ProfileName (SSID),
    Description (network details), Category (public/private/domain), DateCreated and
    DateLastConnected as FILETIME values. Signatures maintain network identification data.

  examples:
    - "ProfileName: CoffeeShop_WiFi (Public WiFi access point)"
    - "ProfileName: HOME-NETWORK-5G (Personal residence network)"
    - "Description: Starbucks Guest Network (Business establishment WiFi)"
    - "Category: 0 (Public network), 1 (Private network), 2 (Domain network)"
    - "DateCreated: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: 2024-01-15 14:30:25)"
    - "DateLastConnected: 0x01DA2F1A2B8C0000 (Recent connection timestamp)"
    - "FirstNetwork: Corporate_Guest (First connected network profile)"
    - "Managed: 1 (Enterprise-managed network profile)"

limitations:
  - "WiFi profiles do NOT prove user was physically present at network locations"
  - "Network connection doesn't indicate duration of stay or actual internet usage"
  - "SSID names can be spoofed or duplicated across different physical locations"
  - "Connection timestamps don't prove sustained network activity"
  - "Profile creation doesn't guarantee successful authentication or data transmission"
  - "WiFi credentials don't indicate what online activities occurred"
  - "Network categories may be incorrect or manually modified"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_location_proof:
    - "WiFi access point MAC addresses and GPS coordinates from wardriving databases"

    - "Cell tower location data correlating with WiFi connection timestamps"
