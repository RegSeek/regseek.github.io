details:
  what: |
    Windows WiFi network profile information including SSID names, security configurations,
    connection properties, network categories, and encrypted credentials for automatic
    reconnection. Network signatures track connection history and first/last connection times.

  forensic_value: |
    Useful for identifying WiFi networks a device has been configured to connect to, which may
    provide investigative leads about potential locations. WiFi profiles can indicate network
    exposure and help correlate device activity with specific environments. Note: WiFi
    profile data provides limited location reliability and requires extensive correlation
    for meaningful geographic conclusions.

  structure: |
    Network profiles stored with GUIDs as registry keys containing ProfileName (SSID),
    Description (network details), Category (public/private/domain), DateCreated and
    DateLastConnected as FILETIME values. Signatures maintain network identification data.

  examples:
    - "ProfileName: CoffeeShop_WiFi (Public WiFi access point)"
    - "ProfileName: HOME-NETWORK-5G (Personal residence network)"
    - "Description: Starbucks Guest Network (Business establishment WiFi)"
    - "Category: 0 (Public network), 1 (Private network), 2 (Domain network)"
    - "DateCreated: 0x01DA2E8F5C6A0000 (FILETIME: 2024-01-15 14:30:25)"
    - "DateLastConnected: 0x01DA2F1A2B8C0000 (Recent connection timestamp)"
    - "FirstNetwork: Corporate_Guest (First connected network profile)"
    - "Managed: 1 (Enterprise-managed network profile)"

limitations:
  - "WiFi profiles do NOT prove user was physically present at network locations"
  - "SSID names can be spoofed or duplicated across different physical locations"
  - "Connection timestamps do NOT prove sustained network activity or duration of stay"
  - "Profile creation does NOT guarantee successful authentication or data transmission"
  - "WiFi data provides WEAK evidence for establishing location patterns or travel history"
  - "Network categories may be incorrect or manually modified"
  - "WiFi credentials do NOT indicate what online activities occurred"
  - "Same SSID names exist in multiple unrelated physical locations worldwide"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_location_proof:

    - "Cell tower location data correlating with WiFi connection timestamps"
