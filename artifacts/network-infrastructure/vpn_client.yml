details:
  what: |
    Commercial VPN clients store configuration including server lists, connection preferences, 
    authentication credentials, and privacy settings. Registry tracks installation data, subscription w
    information, auto-connect preferences, and kill switch configurations for VPN usage analysis.

  forensic_value: |
    Important for investigating privacy-seeking behavior, geographic location obfuscation, and 
    potential evasion techniques. Shows evidence of VPN connectivity, server preferences, and 
    can indicate attempts to hide network traffic or maintain anonymity in communications.

  structure: |
    VPN client configuration includes server endpoints, authentication methods, connection protocols, 
    kill switch settings, and privacy preferences. Subscription data tracks account information, 
    service features, and usage patterns for comprehensive VPN service behavior analysis.

  examples:
    - "NordVPN\\ServerList: us-chicago-123.nordvpn.com"
    - "ExpressVPN\\Protocol: OpenVPN UDP"
    - "CyberGhost\\KillSwitch: 1 (Network kill switch enabled)"
    - "Surfshark\\AutoConnect: 1 (Automatic VPN connection)"
    - "OpenVPN\\ConfigPath: C:\\OpenVPN\\config\\client.ovpn"
    - "Subscription: Premium (Paid VPN service subscription)"
    - "DNSSettings: Private DNS (VPN-provided DNS servers)"

limitations:
  - "VPN client configuration does NOT prove active VPN usage occurred"
  - "Server settings don't indicate successful connection or data transmission"
  - "Kill switch configuration doesn't prove privacy protection was active"
  - "Auto-connect settings don't indicate VPN was actually used"
  - "VPN installation may be for legitimate privacy or business purposes"
  - "Configuration doesn't prove malicious intent or illegal activity"

    - "Application logs showing successful VPN authentication and data transmission"
