details:
  what: |
    Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) manages file transfers in the background 
    using spare network bandwidth. Registry contains service configuration, transfer job metadata, 
    bandwidth throttling settings, and job state information for system and user-initiated transfers.

  forensic_value: |
    BITS is increasingly used by malware for stealthy file downloads, data exfiltration, and 
    command and control communication. Shows evidence of background file transfers, download sources, 
    upload destinations, and can reveal malicious file distribution, data theft operations, or unauthorized software installation.

  structure: |
    Service configuration includes startup type, dependencies, and bandwidth management settings. 
    StateIndex contains job identifiers and transfer metadata. Jobs subkey tracks active and 
    completed transfers with source URLs, destination paths, and authentication information.

  examples:
    - "BITS\\Start: 3 (Manual startup)"
    - "BITS\\Type: 20 (Win32 service, share process)"
    - "BITS\\ObjectName: LocalSystem"
    - "MaxBandwidthPerJob: 2000000 (bytes per second)"
    - "EnableBitsMaxBandwidth: 1"
    - "Job State: Transfer in progress"
    - "StateIndex\\{12345678-1234-5678-9abc-123456789abc}: Job identifier"
    - "Source URL: http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe"
    - "Destination: C:\\temp\\downloaded_malware.exe"

limitations:
  - "BITS job configuration does NOT prove file transfers completed successfully"
  - "Job entries may be created by Windows Update or legitimate applications"
  - "Source URLs in configuration don't prove files were actually downloaded"
  - "Bandwidth settings don't indicate what data was transferred"
  - "Service startup configuration doesn't show actual service activity"
  - "Job state information may be cleared after transfer completion"
  - "Authentication settings don't prove successful server connections"

correlation:
  required_for_definitive_execution_proof:
    - "BITS service logs showing actual transfer activity and completion status"
    - "Network traffic logs confirming connections to source/destination servers"
    - "File system artifacts showing downloaded files at specified destinations"
    - "Process execution logs showing BITS service and related process activity"
    
  strengthens_evidence:
    - "Windows Update logs showing legitimate vs. suspicious BITS usage"
    - "Event logs showing BITS service starts and job completions"
    - "File creation timestamps correlating with BITS transfer windows"
