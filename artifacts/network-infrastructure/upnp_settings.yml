details:
  what: |
    Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) and network discovery configuration controlling automatic device
    discovery, network browsing capabilities, and network location awareness. Manages device
    enumeration services, network neighborhood visibility, and automatic port mapping.

  forensic_value: |
    Critical for investigating network-based attacks that exploit UPnP vulnerabilities for
    unauthorized access and lateral movement. UPnP can be abused for network reconnaissance,
    automatic firewall rule creation, and device compromise. Configuration changes may indicate
    attackers enabling network discovery for infrastructure mapping.

  structure: |
    UPnP service configuration includes device discovery settings, network location awareness
    parameters, and browsing capabilities. Network discovery controls visibility of network
    devices and shared resources with settings for public, private, and domain networks.

  examples:
    - "UPnPHost\\Start: 3 (Manual startup - typical configuration)"
    - "NetworkDiscovery: 1 (Network discovery enabled)"
    - "ShowNetworkComputers: 1 (Show network computers in Explorer)"
    - "EnableDeviceAssociation: 1 (Allow automatic device pairing)"
    - "NetworkLocationAwareness: 1 (NLA service active)"
    - "PublicNetworkDiscovery: 0 (Discovery disabled on public networks)"
    - "NC_AllowNetBridge_NLA: 0 (Network bridging restricted)"
    - "UPnP_Enabled: 1 (UPnP framework enabled for applications)"

limitations:
  - "UPnP configuration does NOT prove devices were discovered or exploited"
  - "Network discovery settings don't indicate actual device enumeration occurred"
  - "Service enablement doesn't show UPnP protocols were used"
  - "Device association settings don't prove automatic pairing happened"
  - "Network location awareness doesn't indicate location detection accuracy"
  - "Settings can be overridden by group policy or application requests"
  - "UPnP enablement doesn't show which applications used UPnP services"
